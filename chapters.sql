Bistritz.--Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at\r\nVienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was\r\nan hour late.  Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse\r\nwhich I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through\r\nthe streets.  I feared to go very far from the station, as we had\r\narrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the\r\nEast; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is\r\nhere of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish\r\nrule.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.\r\nHere I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale.  I had for dinner,\r\nor rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which\r\nwas very good but thirsty.  (Mem. get recipe for Mina.) I asked the\r\nwaiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was\r\na national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the\r\nCarpathians.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI found my smattering of German very useful here, indeed, I don''t know\r\nhow I should be able to get on without it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the\r\nBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the\r\nlibrary regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some\r\nforeknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance\r\nin dealing with a nobleman of that country.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the\r\ncountry, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia,\r\nand Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the\r\nwildest and least known portions of Europe.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality\r\nof the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to\r\ncompare with our own Ordnance Survey Maps; but I found that Bistritz,\r\nthe post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place.  I\r\nshall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when\r\nI talk over my travels with Mina.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct\r\nnationalities:  Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs,\r\nwho are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and\r\nSzekelys in the East and North.  I am going among the latter, who\r\nclaim to be descended from Attila and the Huns.  This may be so, for\r\nwhen the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they\r\nfound the Huns settled in it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the\r\nhorseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of\r\nimaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting.  (Mem.,\r\nI must ask the Count all about them.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had\r\nall sorts of queer dreams.  There was a dog howling all night under my\r\nwindow, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have\r\nbeen the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe,\r\nand was still thirsty.  Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the\r\ncontinuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping\r\nsoundly then.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize\r\nflour which they said was "mamaliga", and egg-plant stuffed with\r\nforcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call "impletata". (Mem.,\r\nget recipe for this also.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight,\r\nor rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station\r\nat 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we\r\nbegan to move.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are\r\nthe trains.  What ought they to be in China?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of\r\nbeauty of every kind.  Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the\r\ntop of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by\r\nrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each\r\nside of them to be subject to great floods.  It takes a lot of water,\r\nand running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in\r\nall sorts of attire.  Some of them were just like the peasants at home\r\nor those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets,\r\nand round hats, and home-made trousers; but others were very\r\npicturesque.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were\r\nvery clumsy about the waist.  They had all full white sleeves of some\r\nkind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of\r\nsomething fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of\r\ncourse there were petticoats under them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian\r\nthan the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white\r\ntrousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly\r\na foot wide, all studded over with brass nails.  They wore high boots,\r\nwith their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and\r\nheavy black moustaches.  They are very picturesque, but do not look\r\nprepossessing.  On the stage they would be set down at once as some\r\nold Oriental band of brigands.  They are, however, I am told, very\r\nharmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is\r\na very interesting old place.  Being practically on the frontier--for\r\nthe Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy\r\nexistence, and it certainly shows marks of it.  Fifty years ago a\r\nseries of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five\r\nseparate occasions.  At the very beginning of the seventeenth century\r\nit underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the\r\ncasualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I\r\nfound, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of\r\ncourse I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a\r\ncheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white\r\nundergarment with a long double apron, front, and back, of coloured\r\nstuff fitting almost too tight for modesty.  When I came close she\r\nbowed and said, "The Herr Englishman?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white\r\nshirtsleeves, who had followed her to the door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe went, but immediately returned with a letter:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians.  I am anxiously expecting\r\nyou.  Sleep well tonight.  At three tomorrow the diligence will\r\nstart for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you.  At the Borgo\r\nPass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me.  I trust\r\nthat your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you\r\nwill enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.--Your friend, Dracula."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n4 May--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,\r\ndirecting him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on\r\nmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and\r\npretended that he could not understand my German.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis could not be true, because up to then he had understood it\r\nperfectly; at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each\r\nother in a frightened sort of way.  He mumbled out that the money had\r\nbeen sent in a letter, and that was all he knew.  When I asked him if\r\nhe knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both\r\nhe and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing\r\nat all, simply refused to speak further.  It was so near the time of\r\nstarting that I had no time to ask anyone else, for it was all very\r\nmysterious and not by any means comforting.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in\r\na hysterical way:  "Must you go?  Oh!  Young Herr, must you go?"  She\r\nwas in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of\r\nwhat German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language\r\nwhich I did not know at all.  I was just able to follow her by asking\r\nmany questions.  When I told her that I must go at once, and that I\r\nwas engaged on important business, she asked again:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do you know what day it is?"  I answered that it was the fourth of\r\nMay.  She shook her head as she said again:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, yes!  I know that!  I know that, but do you know what day it is?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn my saying that I did not understand, she went on:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is the eve of St. George''s Day.  Do you not know that tonight,\r\nwhen the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will\r\nhave full sway?  Do you know where you are going, and what you are\r\ngoing to?"  She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort\r\nher, but without effect.  Finally, she went down on her knees and\r\nimplored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable.  However,\r\nthere was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere\r\nwith it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I\r\nthanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck\r\noffered it to me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been\r\ntaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it\r\nseemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such\r\na state of mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round\r\nmy neck and said, "For your mother''s sake," and went out of the room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the\r\ncoach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my\r\nneck.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhether it is the old lady''s fear, or the many ghostly traditions of\r\nthis place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not\r\nfeeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my\r\ngoodbye.  Here comes the coach!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n5 May.  The Castle.--The gray of the morning has passed, and the sun\r\nis high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with\r\ntrees or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and\r\nlittle are mixed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally\r\nI write till sleep comes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may\r\nfancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my\r\ndinner exactly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI dined on what they called "robber steak"--bits of bacon, onion, and\r\nbeef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks, and roasted over\r\nthe fire, in simple style of the London cat''s meat!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the\r\ntongue, which is, however, not disagreeable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I got on the coach, the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw\r\nhim talking to the landlady.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked\r\nat me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside\r\nthe door--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them\r\npityingly.  I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words,\r\nfor there were many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my\r\npolyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were\r\n"Ordog"--Satan, "Pokol"--hell, "stregoica"--witch, "vrolok" and\r\n"vlkoslak"--both mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other\r\nServian for something that is either werewolf or vampire.  (Mem., I\r\nmust ask the Count about these superstitions.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time\r\nswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and\r\npointed two fingers towards me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell me what they\r\nmeant.  He would not answer at first, but on learning that I was\r\nEnglish, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil\r\neye.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place\r\nto meet an unknown man.  But everyone seemed so kind-hearted, and so\r\nsorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn yard and\r\nits crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they\r\nstood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of\r\noleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the\r\nyard.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of\r\nthe boxseat,--"gotza" they call them--cracked his big whip over his\r\nfour small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of\r\nthe scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or\r\nrather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might\r\nnot have been able to throw them off so easily.  Before us lay a green\r\nsloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep\r\nhills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank\r\ngable end to the road.  There was everywhere a bewildering mass of\r\nfruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry.  And as we drove by I could\r\nsee the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals.\r\nIn and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the\r\n"Mittel Land" ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy\r\ncurve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which\r\nhere and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame.  The road\r\nwas rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste.\r\nI could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was\r\nevidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund.  I was told\r\nthat this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet\r\nbeen put in order after the winter snows.  In this respect it is\r\ndifferent from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is\r\nan old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order.  Of\r\nold the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think\r\nthat they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the\r\nwar which was always really at loading point.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBeyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes\r\nof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves.  Right\r\nand left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon\r\nthem and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful\r\nrange, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and\r\nbrown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of\r\njagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the\r\ndistance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly.  Here and there seemed\r\nmighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to\r\nsink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water.  One of\r\nmy companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and\r\nopened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as\r\nwe wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Look!  Isten szek!"--"God''s seat!"--and he crossed himself reverently.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower\r\nbehind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us.  This\r\nwas emphasized by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\r\nsunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink.  Here and\r\nthere we passed Cszeks and slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I\r\nnoticed that goitre was painfully prevalent.  By the roadside were\r\nmany crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed\r\nthemselves.  Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before\r\na shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in\r\nthe self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the\r\nouter world.  There were many things new to me.  For instance,\r\nhay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of\r\nweeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the\r\ndelicate green of the leaves.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow and again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasants''s\r\ncart--with its long, snakelike vertebra, calculated to suit the\r\ninequalities of the road.  On this were sure to be seated quite a\r\ngroup of homecoming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the\r\nSlovaks with their coloured sheepskins, the latter carrying\r\nlance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end.  As the evening fell\r\nit began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge\r\ninto one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine,\r\nthough in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills,\r\nas we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and\r\nthere against the background of late-lying snow.  Sometimes, as the\r\nroad was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be\r\nclosing down upon us, great masses of greyness which here and there\r\nbestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect,\r\nwhich carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in\r\nthe evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the\r\nghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind\r\nceaselessly through the valleys.  Sometimes the hills were so steep\r\nthat, despite our driver''s haste, the horses could only go slowly.  I\r\nwished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver\r\nwould not hear of it.  "No, no," he said.  "You must not walk here.\r\nThe dogs are too fierce."  And then he added, with what he evidently\r\nmeant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the approving\r\nsmile of the rest--"And you may have enough of such matters before you\r\ngo to sleep."  The only stop he would make was a moment''s pause to\r\nlight his lamps.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\r\npassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\r\nthough urging him to further speed.  He lashed the horses unmercifully\r\nwith his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\r\nto further exertions.  Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\r\npatch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\r\nhills.  The excitement of the passengers grew greater.  The crazy\r\ncoach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat\r\ntossed on a stormy sea.  I had to hold on.  The road grew more level,\r\nand we appeared to fly along.  Then the mountains seemed to come\r\nnearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us.  We were entering\r\non the Borgo Pass.  One by one several of the passengers offered me\r\ngifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take\r\nno denial.  These were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each\r\nwas given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing,\r\nand that same strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had\r\nseen outside the hotel at Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the\r\nguard against the evil eye.  Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned\r\nforward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the\r\ncoach, peered eagerly into the darkness.  It was evident that\r\nsomething very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I\r\nasked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation.\r\nThis state of excitement kept on for some little time.  And at last we\r\nsaw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side.  There were\r\ndark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive\r\nsense of thunder.  It seemed as though the mountain range had\r\nseparated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous\r\none.  I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to\r\ntake me to the Count.  Each moment I expected to see the glare of\r\nlamps through the blackness, but all was dark.  The only light was the\r\nflickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\r\nhard-driven horses rose in a white cloud.  We could see now the sandy\r\nroad lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\r\nThe passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\r\nmy own disappointment.  I was already thinking what I had best do,\r\nwhen the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something\r\nwhich I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a\r\ntone, I thought it was "An hour less than the time."  Then turning to\r\nme, he spoke in German worse than my own.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There is no carriage here.  The Herr is not expected after all.  He\r\nwill now come on to Bukovina, and return tomorrow or the next day,\r\nbetter the next day."  Whilst he was speaking the horses began to\r\nneigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them\r\nup.  Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a\r\nuniversal crossing of themselves, a caleche, with four horses, drove\r\nup behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach.  I could see\r\nfrom the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them, that the horses\r\nwere coal-black and splendid animals.  They were driven by a tall man,\r\nwith a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide\r\nhis face from us.  I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright\r\neyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe said to the driver, "You are early tonight, my friend."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe man stammered in reply, "The English Herr was in a hurry."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo which the stranger replied, "That is why, I suppose, you wished him\r\nto go on to Bukovina.  You cannot deceive me, my friend.  I know too\r\nmuch, and my horses are swift."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth,\r\nwith very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory.  One of\r\nmy companions whispered to another the line from Burger''s "Lenore".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Denn die Todten reiten Schnell."  ("For the dead travel fast.")\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\r\ngleaming smile.  The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\r\nputting out his two fingers and crossing himself.  "Give me the Herr''s\r\nluggage," said the driver, and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\r\nhanded out and put in the caleche.  Then I descended from the side of\r\nthe coach, as the caleche was close alongside, the driver helping me\r\nwith a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel.  His strength must\r\nhave been prodigious.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWithout a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept\r\ninto the darkness of the pass.  As I looked back I saw the steam from\r\nthe horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\r\nagainst it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves.\r\nThen the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off\r\nthey swept on their way to Bukovina.  As they sank into the darkness I\r\nfelt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling come over me.  But a cloak\r\nwas thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the\r\ndriver said in excellent German--"The night is chill, mein Herr, and\r\nmy master the Count bade me take all care of you.  There is a flask of\r\nslivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you\r\nshould require it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the\r\nsame.  I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened.  I\r\nthink had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead\r\nof prosecuting that unknown night journey.  The carriage went at a\r\nhard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along\r\nanother straight road.  It seemed to me that we were simply going over\r\nand over the same ground again, and so I took note of some salient\r\npoint, and found that this was so.  I would have liked to have asked\r\nthe driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I\r\nthought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in\r\ncase there had been an intention to delay.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I\r\nstruck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch.  It was within a\r\nfew minutes of midnight.  This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose\r\nthe general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent\r\nexperiences.  I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road, a\r\nlong, agonized wailing, as if from fear.  The sound was taken up by\r\nanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind\r\nwhich now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which\r\nseemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination\r\ncould grasp it through the gloom of the night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver\r\nspoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and\r\nsweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright.  Then, far off\r\nin the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder\r\nand a sharper howling, that of wolves, which affected both the horses\r\nand myself in the same way.  For I was minded to jump from the caleche\r\nand run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the\r\ndriver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting.\r\nIn a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound,\r\nand the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend\r\nand to stand before them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as\r\nI have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for\r\nunder his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they\r\nstill trembled.  The driver again took his seat, and shaking his\r\nreins, started off at a great pace.  This time, after going to the far\r\nside of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran\r\nsharply to the right.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSoon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over\r\nthe roadway till we passed as through a tunnel.  And again great\r\nfrowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side.  Though we were in\r\nshelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled\r\nthrough the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as\r\nwe swept along.  It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery\r\nsnow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered\r\nwith a white blanket.  The keen wind still carried the howling of the\r\ndogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way.  The baying of\r\nthe wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing\r\nround on us from every side.  I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses\r\nshared my fear.  The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed.\r\nHe kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see\r\nanything through the darkness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly, away on our left I saw a faint flickering blue flame.  The\r\ndriver saw it at the same moment.  He at once checked the horses, and,\r\njumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness.  I did not know\r\nwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer.  But\r\nwhile I wondered, the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a\r\nword took his seat, and we resumed our journey.  I think I must have\r\nfallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be\r\nrepeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful\r\nnightmare.  Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the\r\ndarkness around us I could watch the driver''s motions.  He went\r\nrapidly to where the blue flame arose, it must have been very faint,\r\nfor it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all, and\r\ngathering a few stones, formed them into some device.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce there appeared a strange optical effect.  When he stood between\r\nme and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly\r\nflicker all the same.  This startled me, but as the effect was only\r\nmomentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the\r\ndarkness.  Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped\r\nonwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us,\r\nas though they were following in a moving circle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\r\nhad yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble\r\nworse than ever and to snort and scream with fright.  I could not see\r\nany cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether.\r\nBut just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared\r\nbehind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its\r\nlight I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling\r\nred tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair.  They were a\r\nhundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than\r\neven when they howled.  For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of\r\nfear.  It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such\r\nhorrors that he can understand their true import.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\r\nsome peculiar effect on them.  The horses jumped about and reared, and\r\nlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to\r\nsee.  But the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side,\r\nand they had perforce to remain within it.  I called to the coachman\r\nto come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break\r\nout through the ring and to aid his approach, I shouted and beat the\r\nside of the caleche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from the\r\nside, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap.  How he came\r\nthere, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious\r\ncommand, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway.\r\nAs he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable\r\nobstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still.  Just then a\r\nheavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again\r\nin darkness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I could see again the driver was climbing into the caleche, and\r\nthe wolves disappeared.  This was all so strange and uncanny that a\r\ndreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move.  The\r\ntime seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost\r\ncomplete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in\r\nthe main always ascending.  Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact\r\nthat the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the\r\ncourtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came\r\nno ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line\r\nagainst the sky.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

In\r\nthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several\r\ndark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed\r\nbigger than it really is.  I have not yet been able to see it by\r\ndaylight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the caleche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\r\nto assist me to alight.  Again I could not but notice his prodigious\r\nstrength.  His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\r\ncrushed mine if he had chosen.  Then he took my traps, and placed them\r\non the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\r\nstudded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\r\nmassive stone.  I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\r\nmassively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\r\nweather.  As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook\r\nthe reins.  The horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared\r\ndown one of the dark openings.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do.  Of\r\nbell or knocker there was no sign.  Through these frowning walls and\r\ndark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate.\r\nThe time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding\r\nupon me.  What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of\r\npeople?  What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?\r\nWas this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor''s clerk sent\r\nout to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner?\r\nSolicitor''s clerk!  Mina would not like that.  Solicitor, for just\r\nbefore leaving London I got word that my examination was successful,\r\nand I am now a full-blown solicitor!  I began to rub my eyes and pinch\r\nmyself to see if I were awake.  It all seemed like a horrible\r\nnightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find\r\nmyself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I\r\nhad now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork.  But my\r\nflesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be\r\ndeceived.  I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians.  All I could\r\ndo now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of morning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\r\nbehind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a\r\ncoming light.  Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the\r\nclanking of massive bolts drawn back.  A key was turned with the loud\r\ngrating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWithin, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white\r\nmoustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\r\nof colour about him anywhere.  He held in his hand an antique silver\r\nlamp, in which the flame burned without a chimney or globe of any\r\nkind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught\r\nof the open door.  The old man motioned me in with his right hand with\r\na courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange\r\nintonation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Welcome to my house!  Enter freely and of your own free will!"  He\r\nmade no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as\r\nthough his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone.  The instant,\r\nhowever, that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively\r\nforward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which\r\nmade me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it\r\nseemed cold as ice, more like the hand of a dead than a living man.\r\nAgain he said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Welcome to my house!  Enter freely.  Go safely, and leave something\r\nof the happiness you bring!"  The strength of the handshake was so\r\nmuch akin to that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had\r\nnot seen, that for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person\r\nto whom I was speaking.  So to make sure, I said interrogatively,\r\n"Count Dracula?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe bowed in a courtly way as he replied, "I am Dracula, and I bid you\r\nwelcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.  Come in, the night air is chill,\r\nand you must need to eat and rest."  As he was speaking, he put the lamp\r\non a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, took my luggage.  He had\r\ncarried it in before I could forestall him.  I protested, but he\r\ninsisted.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Nay, sir, you are my guest.  It is late, and my people are not\r\navailable.  Let me see to your comfort myself."  He insisted on carrying\r\nmy traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\r\nalong another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\r\nheavily.  At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I\r\nrejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for\r\nsupper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly\r\nreplenished, flamed and flared.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\r\nthe room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room\r\nlit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.\r\nPassing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to\r\nenter.  It was a welcome sight.  For here was a great bedroom well\r\nlighted and warmed with another log fire, also added to but lately,\r\nfor the top logs were fresh, which sent a hollow roar up the wide\r\nchimney.  The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew,\r\nsaying, before he closed the door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\r\ntoilet.  I trust you will find all you wish.  When you are ready, come\r\ninto the other room, where you will find your supper prepared."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe light and warmth and the Count''s courteous welcome seemed to have\r\ndissipated all my doubts and fears.  Having then reached my normal\r\nstate, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger.  So making a\r\nhasty toilet, I went into the other room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI found supper already laid out.  My host, who stood on one side of\r\nthe great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful\r\nwave of his hand to the table, and said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please.  You will I trust,\r\nexcuse me that I do not join you, but I have dined already, and I do\r\nnot sup."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to\r\nme.  He opened it and read it gravely.  Then, with a charming smile,\r\nhe handed it to me to read.  One passage of it, at least, gave me a\r\nthrill of pleasure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a\r\nconstant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for\r\nsome time to come.  But I am happy to say I can send a sufficient\r\nsubstitute, one in whom I have every possible confidence.  He is a\r\nyoung man, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very\r\nfaithful disposition.  He is discreet and silent, and has grown into\r\nmanhood in my service.  He shall be ready to attend on you when you\r\nwill during his stay, and shall take your instructions in all\r\nmatters."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\r\nfell to at once on an excellent roast chicken.  This, with some cheese\r\nand a salad and a bottle of old tokay, of which I had two glasses, was\r\nmy supper.  During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many\r\nquestions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\r\nexperienced.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy this time I had finished my supper, and by my host''s desire had\r\ndrawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he\r\noffered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke.\r\nI had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very\r\nmarked physiognomy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis face was a strong, a very strong, aquiline, with high bridge of\r\nthe thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils, with lofty domed\r\nforehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely\r\nelsewhere.  His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the\r\nnose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion.\r\nThe mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was\r\nfixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth.\r\nThese protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed\r\nastonishing vitality in a man of his years.  For the rest, his ears\r\nwere pale, and at the tops extremely pointed.  The chin was broad and\r\nstrong, and the cheeks firm though thin.  The general effect was one\r\nof extraordinary pallor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\r\nin the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine.  But\r\nseeing them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were\r\nrather coarse, broad, with squat fingers.  Strange to say, there were\r\nhairs in the centre of the palm.  The nails were long and fine, and\r\ncut to a sharp point.  As the Count leaned over me and his hands\r\ntouched me, I could not repress a shudder.  It may have been that his\r\nbreath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which,\r\ndo what I would, I could not conceal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Count, evidently noticing it, drew back.  And with a grim sort of\r\nsmile, which showed more than he had yet done his protruberant teeth,\r\nsat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace.  We were both\r\nsilent for a while, and as I looked towards the window I saw the first\r\ndim streak of the coming dawn.  There seemed a strange stillness over\r\neverything.  But as I listened, I heard as if from down below in the\r\nvalley the howling of many wolves.  The Count''s eyes gleamed, and he\r\nsaid.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Listen to them, the children of the night.  What music they make!"\r\nSeeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\r\nadded, "Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the\r\nfeelings of the hunter."  Then he rose and said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But you must be tired.  Your bedroom is all ready, and tomorrow you\r\nshall sleep as late as you will.  I have to be away till the\r\nafternoon, so sleep well and dream well!"  With a courteous bow, he\r\nopened for me himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my\r\nbedroom.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am all in a sea of wonders.  I doubt.  I fear.  I think strange\r\nthings, which I dare not confess to my own soul.  God keep me, if only\r\nfor the sake of those dear to me!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n7 May.--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the\r\nlast twenty-four hours.  I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my\r\nown accord.  When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we\r\nhad supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot\r\nby the pot being placed on the hearth.  There was a card on the table,\r\non which was written--"I have to be absent for a while.  Do not wait\r\nfor me.  D."  I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal.  When I had done, I\r\nlooked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know I had\r\nfinished, but I could not find one.  There are certainly odd\r\ndeficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of\r\nwealth which are round me.  The table service is of gold, and so\r\nbeautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.  The curtains\r\nand upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are\r\nof the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of\r\nfabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, though\r\nin excellent order.  I saw something like them in Hampton Court, but\r\nthey were worn and frayed and moth-eaten.  But still in none of the\r\nrooms is there a mirror.  There is not even a toilet glass on my\r\ntable, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I\r\ncould either shave or brush my hair.  I have not yet seen a servant\r\nanywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of\r\nwolves.  Some time after I had finished my meal, I do not know whether\r\nto call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six\r\no''clock when I had it, I looked about for something to read, for I did\r\nnot like to go about the castle until I had asked the Count''s\r\npermission.  There was absolutely nothing in the room, book,\r\nnewspaper, or even writing materials, so I opened another door in the\r\nroom and found a sort of library.  The door opposite mine I tried, but\r\nfound locked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\r\nbooks, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\r\nnewspapers.  A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\r\nand newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date.  The\r\nbooks were of the most varied kind, history, geography, politics,\r\npolitical economy, botany, geology, law, all relating to England and\r\nEnglish life and customs and manners.  There were even such books of\r\nreference as the London Directory, the "Red" and "Blue" books,\r\nWhitaker''s Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and it somehow gladdened\r\nmy heart to see it, the Law List.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\r\nentered.  He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a\r\ngood night''s rest.  Then he went on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much\r\nthat will interest you.  These companions," and he laid his hand on\r\nsome of the books, "have been good friends to me, and for some years\r\npast, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have given me\r\nmany, many hours of pleasure.  Through them I have come to know your\r\ngreat England, and to know her is to love her.  I long to go through\r\nthe crowded streets of your mighty London, to be in the midst of the\r\nwhirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its death,\r\nand all that makes it what it is.  But alas!  As yet I only know your\r\ntongue through books.  To you, my friend, I look that I know it to\r\nspeak."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But, Count," I said, "You know and speak English thoroughly!"  He\r\nbowed gravely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet\r\nI fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel.  True, I\r\nknow the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Indeed," I said, "You speak excellently."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Not so," he answered.  "Well, I know that, did I move and speak in\r\nyour London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger.  That\r\nis not enough for me.  Here I am noble.  I am a Boyar.  The common\r\npeople know me, and I am master.  But a stranger in a strange land, he\r\nis no one.  Men know him not, and to know not is to care not for.  I\r\nam content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he sees me,\r\nor pauses in his speaking if he hears my words, ''Ha, ha!  A stranger!''\r\nI have been so long master that I would be master still, or at least\r\nthat none other should be master of me.  You come to me not alone as\r\nagent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my\r\nnew estate in London.  You shall, I trust, rest here with me a while,\r\nso that by our talking I may learn the English intonation.  And I\r\nwould that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my\r\nspeaking.  I am sorry that I had to be away so long today, but you\r\nwill, I know forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\r\ncome into that room when I chose.  He answered, "Yes, certainly," and\r\nadded.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors\r\nare locked, where of course you will not wish to go.  There is reason\r\nthat all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know\r\nwith my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand."  I said I was\r\nsure of this, and then he went on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not England.  Our ways\r\nare not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things.  Nay,\r\nfrom what you have told me of your experiences already, you know\r\nsomething of what strange things there may be."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis led to much conversation, and as it was evident that he wanted to\r\ntalk, if only for talking''s sake, I asked him many questions regarding\r\nthings that had already happened to me or come within my notice.\r\nSometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by\r\npretending not to understand, but generally he answered all I asked\r\nmost frankly.  Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I\r\nasked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as for\r\ninstance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the\r\nblue flames.  He then explained to me that it was commonly believed\r\nthat on a certain night of the year, last night, in fact, when all\r\nevil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway, a blue flame is seen\r\nover any place where treasure has been concealed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That treasure has been hidden," he went on, "in the region through\r\nwhich you came last night, there can be but little doubt.  For it was\r\nthe ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and\r\nthe Turk.  Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that\r\nhas not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders.  In\r\nthe old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the\r\nHungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them,\r\nmen and women, the aged and the children too, and waited their coming\r\non the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on\r\nthem with their artificial avalanches.  When the invader was\r\ntriumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been\r\nsheltered in the friendly soil."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But how," said I, "can it have remained so long undiscovered, when\r\nthere is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?"\r\nThe Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,\r\nsharp, canine teeth showed out strangely.  He answered:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool!  Those flames\r\nonly appear on one night, and on that night no man of this land will,\r\nif he can help it, stir without his doors.  And, dear sir, even if he\r\ndid he would not know what to do.  Why, even the peasant that you tell\r\nme of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look\r\nin daylight even for his own work.  Even you would not, I dare be\r\nsworn, be able to find these places again?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There you are right," I said.  "I know no more than the dead where\r\neven to look for them."  Then we drifted into other matters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Come," he said at last, "tell me of London and of the house which you\r\nhave procured for me."  With an apology for my remissness, I went into\r\nmy own room to get the papers from my bag.  Whilst I was placing them\r\nin order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and\r\nas I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the\r\nlamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark.  The lamps were\r\nalso lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the\r\nsofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw''s\r\nGuide.  When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table,\r\nand with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts.  He\r\nwas interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about\r\nthe place and its surroundings.  He clearly had studied beforehand all\r\nhe could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at\r\nthe end knew very much more than I did.  When I remarked this, he\r\nanswered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?  When I go\r\nthere I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan, nay, pardon\r\nme.  I fall into my country''s habit of putting your patronymic first,\r\nmy friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid\r\nme.  He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of\r\nthe law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins.  So!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\r\nPurfleet.  When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\r\nnecessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\r\nMr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\r\nplace.  I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and\r\nwhich I inscribe here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"At Purfleet, on a byroad, I came across just such a place as seemed\r\nto be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the\r\nplace was for sale.  It was surrounded by a high wall, of ancient\r\nstructure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a\r\nlarge number of years.  The closed gates are of heavy old oak and\r\niron, all eaten with rust.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre\r\nFace, as the house is four sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of\r\nthe compass.  It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded\r\nby the solid stone wall above mentioned.  There are many trees on it,\r\nwhich make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond\r\nor small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear\r\nand flows away in a fair-sized stream.  The house is very large and of\r\nall periods back, I should say, to mediaeval times, for one part is of\r\nstone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily\r\nbarred with iron.  It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an\r\nold chapel or church.  I could not enter it, as I had not the key of\r\nthe door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my Kodak\r\nviews of it from various points.  The house had been added to, but in\r\na very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it\r\ncovers, which must be very great.  There are but few houses close at\r\nhand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed\r\ninto a private lunatic asylum.  It is not, however, visible from the\r\ngrounds."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I had finished, he said, "I am glad that it is old and big.  I\r\nmyself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me.\r\nA house cannot be made habitable in a day, and after all, how few days\r\ngo to make up a century.  I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old\r\ntimes.  We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may\r\nlie amongst the common dead.  I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the\r\nbright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which\r\nplease the young and gay.  I am no longer young, and my heart, through\r\nweary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth.  Moreover,\r\nthe walls of my castle are broken.  The shadows are many, and the wind\r\nbreathes cold through the broken battlements and casements.  I love\r\nthe shade and the shadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I\r\nmay."  Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else\r\nit was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and\r\nsaturnine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPresently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to pull my papers\r\ntogether.  He was some little time away, and I began to look at some\r\nof the books around me.  One was an atlas, which I found opened\r\nnaturally to England, as if that map had been much used.  On looking\r\nat it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining\r\nthese I noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly\r\nwhere his new estate was situated.  The other two were Exeter, and\r\nWhitby on the Yorkshire coast.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was the better part of an hour when the Count returned.  "Aha!" he\r\nsaid.  "Still at your books?  Good!  But you must not work always.\r\nCome!  I am informed that your supper is ready."  He took my arm, and\r\nwe went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on\r\nthe table.  The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on\r\nhis being away from home.  But he sat as on the previous night, and\r\nchatted whilst I ate.  After supper I smoked, as on the last evening,\r\nand the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every\r\nconceivable subject, hour after hour.  I felt that it was getting very\r\nlate indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation\r\nto meet my host''s wishes in every way.  I was not sleepy, as the long\r\nsleep yesterday had fortified me, but I could not help experiencing\r\nthat chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is\r\nlike, in its way, the turn of the tide.  They say that people who are\r\nnear death die generally at the change to dawn or at the turn of the\r\ntide.  Anyone who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post,\r\nexperienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it.  All at\r\nonce we heard the crow of the cock coming up with preternatural\r\nshrillness through the clear morning air.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCount Dracula, jumping to his feet, said, "Why there is the morning\r\nagain!  How remiss I am to let you stay up so long.  You must make\r\nyour conversation regarding my dear new country of England less\r\ninteresting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us," and with\r\na courtly bow, he quickly left me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went into my room and drew the curtains, but there was little to\r\nnotice.  My window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the\r\nwarm grey of quickening sky.  So I pulled the curtains again, and have\r\nwritten of this day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n8 May.--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too\r\ndiffuse.  But now I am glad that I went into detail from the first,\r\nfor there is something so strange about this place and all in it that\r\nI cannot but feel uneasy.  I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\r\nnever come.  It may be that this strange night existence is telling on\r\nme, but would that that were all!  If there were any one to talk to I\r\ncould bear it, but there is no one.  I have only the Count to speak\r\nwith, and he--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the\r\nplace.  Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be.  It will help me to\r\nbear up, and imagination must not run riot with me.  If it does I am\r\nlost.  Let me say at once how I stand, or seem to.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\r\nnot sleep any more, got up.  I had hung my shaving glass by the\r\nwindow, and was just beginning to shave.  Suddenly I felt a hand on my\r\nshoulder, and heard the Count''s voice saying to me, "Good morning."  I\r\nstarted, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the\r\nreflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me.  In starting\r\nI had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment.  Having\r\nanswered the Count''s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see\r\nhow I had been mistaken.  This time there could be no error, for the\r\nman was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder.  But there\r\nwas no reflection of him in the mirror!  The whole room behind me was\r\ndisplayed, but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis was startling, and coming on the top of so many strange things,\r\nwas beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I\r\nalways have when the Count is near.  But at the instant I saw that the\r\ncut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin.  I\r\nlaid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some\r\nsticking plaster.  When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a\r\nsort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat.  I\r\ndrew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the\r\ncrucifix.  It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so\r\nquickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Take care," he said, "take care how you cut yourself.  It is more\r\ndangerous that you think in this country."  Then seizing the shaving\r\nglass, he went on, "And this is the wretched thing that has done the\r\nmischief.  It is a foul bauble of man''s vanity.  Away with it!"  And\r\nopening the window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out\r\nthe glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of\r\nthe courtyard far below.  Then he withdrew without a word.  It is very\r\nannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case\r\nor the bottom of the shaving pot, which is fortunately of metal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I went into the dining room, breakfast was prepared, but I could\r\nnot find the Count anywhere.  So I breakfasted alone.  It is strange\r\nthat as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink.  He must be a very\r\npeculiar man!  After breakfast I did a little exploring in the\r\ncastle.  I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards\r\nthe South.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every\r\nopportunity of seeing it.  The castle is on the very edge of a\r\nterrific precipice.  A stone falling from the window would fall a\r\nthousand feet without touching anything!  As far as the eye can reach\r\nis a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there\r\nis a chasm.  Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind\r\nin deep gorges through the forests.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view\r\nI explored further.  Doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked\r\nand bolted.  In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is\r\nthere an available exit.  The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a\r\nprisoner!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

('dracula', 3, '\r\n<h3 align="center">\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 align="center">\r\nJonathan Harker''s Journal Continued\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over\r\nme.  I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering\r\nout of every window I could find, but after a little the conviction of\r\nmy helplessness overpowered all other feelings.  When I look back\r\nafter a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I\r\nbehaved much as a rat does in a trap.  When, however, the conviction\r\nhad come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly, as quietly as I\r\nhave ever done anything in my life, and began to think over what was\r\nbest to be done.  I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no\r\ndefinite conclusion.  Of one thing only am I certain.  That it is no\r\nuse making my ideas known to the Count.  He knows well that I am\r\nimprisoned, and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own\r\nmotives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with\r\nthe facts.  So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my\r\nknowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open.  I am, I know,\r\neither being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in\r\ndesperate straits, and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need,\r\nall my brains to get through.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below\r\nshut, and knew that the Count had returned.  He did not come at once\r\ninto the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him\r\nmaking the bed.  This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along\r\nthought, that there are no servants in the house.  When later I saw\r\nhim through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in\r\nthe dining room, I was assured of it.  For if he does himself all\r\nthese menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else in\r\nthe castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of\r\nthe coach that brought me here.  This is a terrible thought, for if\r\nso, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by\r\nonly holding up his hand for silence?  How was it that all the people\r\nat Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me?  What\r\nmeant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of\r\nthe mountain ash?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck!  For\r\nit is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it.  It is odd\r\nthat a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as\r\nidolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help.  Is\r\nit that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that\r\nit is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and\r\ncomfort?  Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try\r\nto make up my mind about it.  In the meantime I must find out all I\r\ncan about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand.  Tonight he\r\nmay talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way.  I must be\r\nvery careful, however, not to awake his suspicion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMidnight.--I have had a long talk with the Count.  I asked him a few\r\nquestions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject\r\nwonderfully.  In his speaking of things and people, and especially of\r\nbattles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all.  This he\r\nafterwards explained by saying that to a Boyar the pride of his house\r\nand name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their\r\nfate is his fate.  Whenever he spoke of his house he always said "we",\r\nand spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking.  I wish I could\r\nput down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most\r\nfascinating.  It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country.\r\nHe grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his\r\ngreat white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands\r\nas though he would crush it by main strength.  One thing he said which\r\nI shall put down as nearly as I can, for it tells in its way the story\r\nof his race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the\r\nblood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship.\r\nHere, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down\r\nfrom Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which\r\ntheir Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of\r\nEurope, aye, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that\r\nthe werewolves themselves had come.  Here, too, when they came, they\r\nfound the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living\r\nflame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood\r\nof those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the\r\ndevils in the desert.  Fools, fools!  What devil or what witch was\r\never so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?"  He held up\r\nhis arms.  "Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race, that we\r\nwere proud, that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar,\r\nor the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back?\r\nIs it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the\r\nHungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier,\r\nthat the Honfoglalas was completed there?  And when the Hungarian\r\nflood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the\r\nvictorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding\r\nof the frontier of Turkeyland.  Aye, and more than that, endless duty\r\nof the frontier guard, for as the Turks say, ''water sleeps, and the\r\nenemy is sleepless.''  Who more gladly than we throughout the Four\r\nNations received the ''bloody sword,'' or at its warlike call flocked\r\nquicker to the standard of the King?  When was redeemed that great\r\nshame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the\r\nWallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent?  Who was it but\r\none of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk\r\non his own ground?  This was a Dracula indeed!  Woe was it that his\r\nown unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk\r\nand brought the shame of slavery on them!  Was it not this Dracula,\r\nindeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again\r\nand again brought his forces over the great river into Turkeyland,\r\nwho, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, though he had to\r\ncome alone from the bloody field where his troops were being\r\nslaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph!\r\nThey said that he thought only of himself.  Bah!  What good are\r\npeasants without a leader?  Where ends the war without a brain and\r\nheart to conduct it?  Again, when, after the battle of Mohacs, we\r\nthrew off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst\r\ntheir leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free.\r\nAh, young sir, the Szekelys, and the Dracula as their heart''s blood,\r\ntheir brains, and their swords, can boast a record that mushroom\r\ngrowths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach.  The\r\nwarlike days are over.  Blood is too precious a thing in these days of\r\ndishonourable peace, and the glories of the great races are as a tale\r\nthat is told."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed.  (Mem., this\r\ndiary seems horribly like the beginning of the "Arabian Nights," for\r\neverything has to break off at cockcrow, or like the ghost of Hamlet''s\r\nfather.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n12 May.--Let me begin with facts, bare, meager facts, verified by\r\nbooks and figures, and of which there can be no doubt.  I must not\r\nconfuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own\r\nobservation, or my memory of them.  Last evening when the Count came\r\nfrom his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on\r\nthe doing of certain kinds of business.  I had spent the day wearily\r\nover books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of\r\nthe matters I had been examined in at Lincoln''s Inn.  There was a\r\ncertain method in the Count''s inquiries, so I shall try to put them\r\ndown in sequence.  The knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to\r\nme.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFirst, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more.\r\nI told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not\r\nbe wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as\r\nonly one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to\r\nmilitate against his interest.  He seemed thoroughly to understand,\r\nand went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having\r\none man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after\r\nshipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home\r\nof the banking solicitor.  I asked to explain more fully, so that I\r\nmight not by any chance mislead him, so he said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I shall illustrate.  Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from\r\nunder the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far\r\nfrom London, buys for me through your good self my place at London.\r\nGood!  Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange\r\nthat I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead\r\nof some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest\r\nmight be served save my wish only, and as one of London residence\r\nmight, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I\r\nwent thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my\r\ninterest.  Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship\r\ngoods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it\r\nnot be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in\r\nthese ports?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we\r\nsolicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local\r\nwork could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that\r\nthe client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have\r\nhis wishes carried out by him without further trouble.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But," said he, "I could be at liberty to direct myself.  Is it not\r\nso?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Of course," I replied, and "Such is often done by men of business,\r\nwho do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one\r\nperson."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good!" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making\r\nconsignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of\r\ndifficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded\r\nagainst.  I explained all these things to him to the best of my\r\nability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would\r\nhave made a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not\r\nthink of or foresee.  For a man who was never in the country, and who\r\ndid not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and\r\nacumen were wonderful.  When he had satisfied himself on these points\r\nof which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by\r\nthe books available, he suddenly stood up and said, "Have you written\r\nsince your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any\r\nother?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had\r\nnot, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to\r\nanybody.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then write now, my young friend," he said, laying a heavy hand on my\r\nshoulder, "write to our friend and to any other, and say, if it will\r\nplease you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do you wish me to stay so long?" I asked, for my heart grew cold at\r\nthe thought.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I desire it much, nay I will take no refusal.  When your master,\r\nemployer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his\r\nbehalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted.  I\r\nhave not stinted.  Is it not so?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat could I do but bow acceptance?  It was Mr. Hawkins'' interest, not\r\nmine, and I had to think of him, not myself, and besides, while Count\r\nDracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing\r\nwhich made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it\r\nI could have no choice.  The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his\r\nmastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them,\r\nbut in his own smooth, resistless way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of\r\nthings other than business in your letters.  It will doubtless please\r\nyour friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to\r\ngetting home to them.  Is it not so?"  As he spoke he handed me three\r\nsheets of note paper and three envelopes.  They were all of the\r\nthinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing\r\nhis quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red\r\nunderlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be\r\nmore careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it.  So I\r\ndetermined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr.\r\nHawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write\r\nshorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it.  When I had\r\nwritten my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count\r\nwrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his\r\ntable.  Then he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put\r\nby his writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed\r\nbehind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face\r\ndown on the table.  I felt no compunction in doing so for under the\r\ncircumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I\r\ncould.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The\r\nCrescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna.  The third was to\r\nCoutts &amp; Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock &amp; Billreuth,\r\nbankers, Buda Pesth.  The second and fourth were unsealed.  I was just\r\nabout to look at them when I saw the door handle move.  I sank back in\r\nmy seat, having just had time to resume my book before the Count,\r\nholding still another letter in his hand, entered the room.  He took\r\nup the letters on the table and stamped them carefully, and then\r\nturning to me, said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private\r\nthis evening.  You will, I hope, find all things as you wish."  At the\r\ndoor he turned, and after a moment''s pause said, "Let me advise you,\r\nmy dear young friend.  Nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that\r\nshould you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in\r\nany other part of the castle.  It is old, and has many memories, and\r\nthere are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.  Be warned!  Should\r\nsleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then haste to your\r\nown chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be safe.  But\r\nif you be not careful in this respect, then," He finished his speech\r\nin a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing\r\nthem.  I quite understood.  My only doubt was as to whether any dream\r\ncould be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and\r\nmystery which seemed closing around me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no\r\ndoubt in question.  I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is\r\nnot.  I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed, I imagine\r\nthat my rest is thus freer from dreams, and there it shall remain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he left me I went to my room.  After a little while, not hearing\r\nany sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could\r\nlook out towards the South.  There was some sense of freedom in the\r\nvast expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the\r\nnarrow darkness of the courtyard.  Looking out on this, I felt that I\r\nwas indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air,\r\nthough it were of the night.  I am beginning to feel this nocturnal\r\nexistence tell on me.  It is destroying my nerve.  I start at my own\r\nshadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings.  God knows\r\nthat there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place!  I\r\nlooked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight\r\ntill it was almost as light as day.  In the soft light the distant\r\nhills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of\r\nvelvety blackness.  The mere beauty seemed to cheer me.  There was\r\npeace and comfort in every breath I drew.  As I leaned from the window\r\nmy eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat\r\nto my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the\r\nwindows of the Count''s own room would look out.  The window at which I\r\nstood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was\r\nstill complete.  But it was evidently many a day since the case had\r\nbeen there.  I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully\r\nout.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat I saw was the Count''s head coming out from the window.  I did not\r\nsee the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his\r\nback and arms.  In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had\r\nhad some many opportunities of studying.  I was at first interested\r\nand somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will\r\ninterest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner.  But my very feelings\r\nchanged to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge\r\nfrom the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over the\r\ndreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like\r\ngreat wings.  At first I could not believe my eyes.  I thought it was\r\nsome trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow, but I kept\r\nlooking, and it could be no delusion.  I saw the fingers and toes\r\ngrasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the\r\nstress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality\r\nmove downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a\r\nwall.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat manner of man is this, or what manner of creature, is it in the\r\nsemblance of man?  I feel the dread of this horrible place\r\noverpowering me.  I am in fear, in awful fear, and there is no escape\r\nfor me.  I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n15 May.--Once more I have seen the count go out in his lizard fashion.\r\nHe moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a\r\ngood deal to the left.  He vanished into some hole or window.  When\r\nhis head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but\r\nwithout avail.  The distance was too great to allow a proper angle of\r\nsight.  I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the\r\nopportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet.  I went\r\nback to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors.  They were\r\nall locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new.\r\nBut I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered\r\noriginally.  I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and\r\nunhook the great chains.  But the door was locked, and the key was\r\ngone!  That key must be in the Count''s room.  I must watch should his\r\ndoor be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape.  I went on to make\r\na thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try\r\nthe doors that opened from them.  One or two small rooms near the hall\r\nwere open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture,\r\ndusty with age and moth-eaten.  At last, however, I found one door at\r\nthe top of the stairway which, though it seemed locked, gave a little\r\nunder pressure.  I tried it harder, and found that it was not really\r\nlocked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had\r\nfallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor.  Here was an\r\nopportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and\r\nwith many efforts forced it back so that I could enter.  I was now in\r\na wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a\r\nstorey lower down.  From the windows I could see that the suite of\r\nrooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end\r\nroom looking out both west and south.  On the latter side, as well as\r\nto the former, there was a great precipice.  The castle was built on\r\nthe corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite\r\nimpregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow,\r\nor culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,\r\nimpossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured.  To\r\nthe west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged\r\nmountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with\r\nmountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and\r\ncrannies of the stone.  This was evidently the portion of the castle\r\noccupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more an\r\nair of comfort than any I had seen.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in\r\nthrough the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it\r\nsoftened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some\r\nmeasure the ravages of time and moth.  My lamp seemed to be of little\r\neffect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me,\r\nfor there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart\r\nand made my nerves tremble.  Still, it was better than living alone in\r\nthe rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count, and\r\nafter trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude\r\ncome over me.  Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old\r\ntimes possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many\r\nblushes, her ill-spelt love letter, and writing in my diary in\r\nshorthand all that has happened since I closed it last.  It is the\r\nnineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance.  And yet, unless my\r\nsenses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their\r\nown which mere "modernity" cannot kill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater:  The morning of 16 May.--God preserve my sanity, for to this I\r\nam reduced.  Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the\r\npast.  Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that\r\nI may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already.  If I be sane,\r\nthen surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that\r\nlurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me, that\r\nto him alone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I\r\ncan serve his purpose.  Great God!  Merciful God, let me be calm, for\r\nout of that way lies madness indeed.  I begin to get new lights on\r\ncertain things which have puzzled me.  Up to now I never quite knew\r\nwhat Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say, "My tablets!  Quick,\r\nmy tablets!  ''tis meet that I put it down," etc., For now, feeling as\r\nthough my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which\r\nmust end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.  The habit of\r\nentering accurately must help to soothe me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Count''s mysterious warning frightened me at the time.  It frightens\r\nme more not when I think of it, for in the future he has a fearful\r\nhold upon me.  I shall fear to doubt what he may say!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book\r\nand pen in my pocket I felt sleepy.  The Count''s warning came into my\r\nmind, but I took pleasure in disobeying it.  The sense of sleep was\r\nupon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider.  The\r\nsoft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of\r\nfreedom which refreshed me.  I determined not to return tonight to the\r\ngloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat\r\nand sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad\r\nfor their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars.  I drew a\r\ngreat couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I\r\ncould look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and\r\nuncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep.  I suppose I must\r\nhave fallen asleep.  I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was\r\nstartlingly real, so real that now sitting here in the broad, full\r\nsunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all\r\nsleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was not alone.  The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I\r\ncame into it.  I could see along the floor, in the brilliant\r\nmoonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long\r\naccumulation of dust.  In the moonlight opposite me were three young\r\nwomen, ladies by their dress and manner.  I thought at the time that I\r\nmust be dreaming when I saw them, they threw no shadow on the floor.\r\nThey came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then\r\nwhispered together.  Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like\r\nthe Count, and great dark, piercing eyes, that seemed to be almost red\r\nwhen contrasted with the pale yellow moon.  The other was fair, as\r\nfair as can be, with great masses of golden hair and eyes like pale\r\nsapphires.  I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in\r\nconnection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the\r\nmoment how or where.  All three had brilliant white teeth that shone\r\nlike pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips.  There was\r\nsomething about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same\r\ntime some deadly fear.  I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire\r\nthat they would kiss me with those red lips.  It is not good to note\r\nthis down, lest some day it should meet Mina''s eyes and cause her\r\npain, but it is the truth.  They whispered together, and then they all\r\nthree laughed, such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though\r\nthe sound never could have come through the softness of human lips.\r\nIt was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of waterglasses when\r\nplayed on by a cunning hand.  The fair girl shook her head\r\ncoquettishly, and the other two urged her on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne said, "Go on!  You are first, and we shall follow.  Yours is the\r\nright to begin."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe other added, "He is young and strong.  There are kisses for us\r\nall."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI lay quiet, looking out from under my eyelashes in an agony of\r\ndelightful anticipation.  The fair girl advanced and bent over me till\r\nI could feel the movement of her breath upon me.  Sweet it was in one\r\nsense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as\r\nher voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter\r\noffensiveness, as one smells in blood.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly\r\nunder the lashes.  The girl went on her knees, and bent over me,\r\nsimply gloating.  There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both\r\nthrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually\r\nlicked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the\r\nmoisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it\r\nlapped the white sharp teeth.  Lower and lower went her head as the\r\nlips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed to fasten on\r\nmy throat.  Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of\r\nher tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and I could feel the hot\r\nbreath on my neck.  Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as\r\none''s flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer,\r\nnearer.  I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the\r\nsuper sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp\r\nteeth, just touching and pausing there.  I closed my eyes in\r\nlanguorous ecstasy and waited, waited with beating heart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as\r\nlightning.  I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his\r\nbeing as if lapped in a storm of fury.  As my eyes opened\r\ninvoluntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair\r\nwoman and with giant''s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed\r\nwith fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks\r\nblazing red with passion.  But the Count!  Never did I imagine such\r\nwrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit.  His eyes were\r\npositively blazing.  The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames\r\nof hell fire blazed behind them.  His face was deathly pale, and the\r\nlines of it were hard like drawn wires.  The thick eyebrows that met\r\nover the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal.  With\r\na fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then\r\nmotioned to the others, as though he were beating them back.  It was\r\nthe same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves.  In a\r\nvoice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through\r\nthe air and then ring in the room he said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How dare you touch him, any of you?  How dare you cast eyes on him\r\nwhen I had forbidden it?  Back, I tell you all!  This man belongs to\r\nme!  Beware how you meddle with him, or you''ll have to deal with me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him.\r\n"You yourself never loved.  You never love!"  On this the other women\r\njoined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the\r\nroom that it almost made me faint to hear.  It seemed like the\r\npleasure of fiends.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said\r\nin a soft whisper, "Yes, I too can love.  You yourselves can tell it\r\nfrom the past.  Is it not so?  Well, now I promise you that when I am\r\ndone with him you shall kiss him at your will.  Now go!  Go!  I must\r\nawaken him, for there is work to be done."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Are we to have nothing tonight?" said one of them, with a low laugh,\r\nas she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and\r\nwhich moved as though there were some living thing within it.  For\r\nanswer he nodded his head.  One of the women jumped forward and opened\r\nit.  If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as\r\nof a half smothered child.  The women closed round, whilst I was\r\naghast with horror.  But as I looked, they disappeared, and with them\r\nthe dreadful bag.  There was no door near them, and they could not\r\nhave passed me without my noticing.  They simply seemed to fade into\r\nthe rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could\r\nsee outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely\r\nfaded away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

('dracula', 4, '\r\n<h3 align="center">\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 align="center">\r\nJonathan Harker''s Journal Continued\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI awoke in my own bed.  If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must\r\nhave carried me here.  I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but\r\ncould not arrive at any unquestionable result.  To be sure, there were\r\ncertain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid\r\nby in a manner which was not my habit.  My watch was still unwound,\r\nand I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going\r\nto bed, and many such details.  But these things are no proof, for\r\nthey may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, for\r\nsome cause or another, I had certainly been much upset.  I must watch\r\nfor proof.  Of one thing I am glad.  If it was that the Count carried\r\nme here and undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for\r\nmy pockets are intact.  I am sure this diary would have been a mystery\r\nto him which he would not have brooked.  He would have taken or\r\ndestroyed it.  As I look round this room, although it has been to me\r\nso full of fear, it is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be\r\nmore dreadful than those awful women, who were, who are, waiting to\r\nsuck my blood.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n18 May.--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for\r\nI must know the truth.  When I got to the doorway at the top of the\r\nstairs I found it closed.  It had been so forcibly driven against the\r\njamb that part of the woodwork was splintered.  I could see that the\r\nbolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the\r\ninside.  I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n19 May.--I am surely in the toils.  Last night the Count asked me in\r\nthe suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here\r\nwas nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,\r\nanother that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the\r\nletter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at\r\nBistritz.  I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present\r\nstate of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count\r\nwhilst I am so absolutely in his power.  And to refuse would be to\r\nexcite his suspicion and to arouse his anger.  He knows that I know\r\ntoo much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him.  My\r\nonly chance is to prolong my opportunities.  Something may occur which\r\nwill give me a chance to escape.  I saw in his eyes something of that\r\ngathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from\r\nhim.  He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that\r\nmy writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends.  And he\r\nassured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the\r\nlater letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in\r\ncase chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him\r\nwould have been to create new suspicion.  I therefore pretended to\r\nfall in with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the\r\nletters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe calculated a minute, and then said, "The first should be June 12,\r\nthe second June 19, and the third June 29."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI know now the span of my life.  God help me!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n28 May.--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to\r\nsend word home.  A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are\r\nencamped in the courtyard.  These are gipsies.  I have notes of them\r\nin my book.  They are peculiar to this part of the world, though\r\nallied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over.  There are\r\nthousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside\r\nall law.  They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or\r\nboyar, and call themselves by his name.  They are fearless and without\r\nreligion, save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of\r\nthe Romany tongue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have\r\nthem posted.  I have already spoken to them through my window to begin\r\nacquaintanceship.  They took their hats off and made obeisance and\r\nmany signs, which however, I could not understand any more than I\r\ncould their spoken language&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have written the letters.  Mina''s is in shorthand, and I simply ask\r\nMr. Hawkins to communicate with her.  To her I have explained my\r\nsituation, but without the horrors which I may only surmise.  It would\r\nshock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her.\r\nShould the letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my\r\nsecret or the extent of my knowledge.&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have given the letters.  I threw them through the bars of my window\r\nwith a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted.\r\nThe man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then\r\nput them in his cap.  I could do no more.  I stole back to the study,\r\nand began to read.  As the Count did not come in, I have written\r\nhere&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Count has come.  He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest\r\nvoice as he opened two letters, "The Szgany has given me these, of\r\nwhich, though I know not whence they come, I shall, of course, take\r\ncare.  See!"--He must have looked at it.--"One is from you, and to my\r\nfriend Peter Hawkins.  The other,"--here he caught sight of the\r\nstrange symbols as he opened the envelope, and the dark look came into\r\nhis face, and his eyes blazed wickedly,--"The other is a vile thing,\r\nan outrage upon friendship and hospitality!  It is not signed.  Well!\r\nSo it cannot matter to us."  And he calmly held letter and envelope in\r\nthe flame of the lamp till they were consumed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen he went on, "The letter to Hawkins, that I shall, of course send\r\non, since it is yours.  Your letters are sacred to me.  Your pardon,\r\nmy friend, that unknowingly I did break the seal.  Will you not cover\r\nit again?"  He held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow\r\nhanded me a clean envelope.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence.  When he went\r\nout of the room I could hear the key turn softly.  A minute later I\r\nwent over and tried it, and the door was locked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his\r\ncoming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa.  He was very\r\ncourteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been\r\nsleeping, he said, "So, my friend, you are tired?  Get to bed.  There\r\nis the surest rest.  I may not have the pleasure of talk tonight,\r\nsince there are many labours to me, but you will sleep, I pray."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI passed to my room and went to bed, and, strange to say, slept\r\nwithout dreaming.  Despair has its own calms.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n31 May.--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself\r\nwith some papers and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket,\r\nso that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a\r\nsurprise, again a shock!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEvery scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,\r\nrelating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that\r\nmight be useful to me were I once outside the castle.  I sat and\r\npondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made\r\nsearch of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my\r\nclothes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and\r\nrug.  I could find no trace of them anywhere.  This looked like some\r\nnew scheme of villainy&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n17 June.--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed\r\ncudgelling my brains, I heard without a crackling of whips and\r\npounding and scraping of horses'' feet up the rocky path beyond the\r\ncourtyard.  With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the\r\nyard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and\r\nat the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great\r\nnail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots.  They had also\r\ntheir long staves in hand.  I ran to the door, intending to descend\r\nand try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that way\r\nmight be opened for them.  Again a shock, my door was fastened on the\r\noutside.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen I ran to the window and cried to them.  They looked up at me\r\nstupidly and pointed, but just then the "hetman" of the Szgany came\r\nout, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which\r\nthey laughed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHenceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonized entreaty,\r\nwould make them even look at me.  They resolutely turned away.  The\r\nleiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick\r\nrope.  These were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks\r\nhandled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner\r\nof the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and\r\nspitting on it for luck, lazily went each to his horse''s head.\r\nShortly afterwards, I heard the crackling of their whips die away in\r\nthe distance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n24 June.--Last night the Count left me early, and locked himself into\r\nhis own room.  As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, and\r\nlooked out of the window, which opened South.  I thought I would watch\r\nfor the Count, for there is something going on.  The Szgany are\r\nquartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind.  I\r\nknow it, for now and then, I hear a far-away muffled sound as of\r\nmattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some\r\nruthless villainy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw\r\nsomething coming out of the Count''s window.  I drew back and watched\r\ncarefully, and saw the whole man emerge.  It was a new shock to me to\r\nfind that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst\r\ntravelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I\r\nhad seen the women take away.  There could be no doubt as to his\r\nquest, and in my garb, too!  This, then, is his new scheme of evil,\r\nthat he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may\r\nboth leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages\r\nposting my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall\r\nby the local people be attributed to me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up\r\nhere, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law\r\nwhich is even a criminal''s right and consolation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought I would watch for the Count''s return, and for a long time\r\nsat doggedly at the window.  Then I began to notice that there were\r\nsome quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight.  They\r\nwere like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and\r\ngathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way.  I watched them with a\r\nsense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me.  I leaned back in\r\nthe embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy\r\nmore fully the aerial gambolling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSomething made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere\r\nfar below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight.  Louder it\r\nseemed to ring in my ears, and the floating moats of dust to take new\r\nshapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight.  I felt myself\r\nstruggling to awake to some call of my instincts.  Nay, my very soul\r\nwas struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to\r\nanswer the call.  I was becoming hypnotised!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nQuicker and quicker danced the dust.  The moonbeams seemed to quiver\r\nas they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond.  More and more they\r\ngathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes.  And then I\r\nstarted, broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran\r\nscreaming from the place.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from\r\nthe moonbeams, were those three ghostly women to whom I was doomed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no\r\nmoonlight, and where the lamp was burning brightly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the\r\nCount''s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed.  And\r\nthen there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me.  With a\r\nbeating heart, I tried the door, but I was locked in my prison, and\r\ncould do nothing.  I sat down and simply cried.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without, the agonised cry of\r\na woman.  I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered between\r\nthe bars.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her hands\r\nover her heart as one distressed with running.  She was leaning\r\nagainst the corner of the gateway.  When she saw my face at the window\r\nshe threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace,\r\n"Monster, give me my child!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the\r\nsame words in tones which wrung my heart.  Then she tore her hair and\r\nbeat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of\r\nextravagant emotion.  Finally, she threw herself forward, and though I\r\ncould not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against\r\nthe door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSomewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of\r\nthe Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper.  His call seemed to\r\nbe answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves.  Before many\r\nminutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when\r\nliberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but\r\nshort.  Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and\r\nshe was better dead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat shall I do?  What can I do?  How can I escape from this dreadful\r\nthing of night, gloom, and fear?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n25 June.--No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet\r\nand dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.  When the sun grew\r\nso high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway\r\nopposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if\r\nthe dove from the ark had lighted there.  My fear fell from me as if\r\nit had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon\r\nme.  Last night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first\r\nof that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my\r\nexistence from the earth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLet me not think of it.  Action!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt has always been at night-time that I have been molested or\r\nthreatened, or in some way in danger or in fear.  I have not yet seen\r\nthe Count in the daylight.  Can it be that he sleeps when others wake,\r\nthat he may be awake whilst they sleep?  If I could only get into his\r\nroom!  But there is no possible way.  The door is always locked, no\r\nway for me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYes, there is a way, if one dares to take it.  Where his body has gone\r\nwhy may not another body go?  I have seen him myself crawl from his\r\nwindow.  Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window?  The\r\nchances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still.  I shall\r\nrisk it.  At the worst it can only be death, and a man''s death is not\r\na calf''s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me.  God help\r\nme in my task!  Goodbye, Mina, if I fail.  Goodbye, my faithful friend\r\nand second father.  Goodbye, all, and last of all Mina!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSame day, later.--I have made the effort, and God helping me, have\r\ncome safely back to this room.  I must put down every detail in order.\r\nI went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south\r\nside, and at once got outside on this side.  The stones are big and\r\nroughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away\r\nbetween them.  I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate\r\nway.  I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of\r\nthe awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes\r\naway from it.  I know pretty well the direction and distance of the\r\nCount''s window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to\r\nthe opportunities available.  I did not feel dizzy, I suppose I was\r\ntoo excited, and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found\r\nmyself standing on the window sill and trying to raise up the sash.  I\r\nwas filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet\r\nforemost in through the window.  Then I looked around for the Count,\r\nbut with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.  The room was\r\nempty!  It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have\r\nnever been used.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms,\r\nand was covered with dust.  I looked for the key, but it was not in\r\nthe lock, and I could not find it anywhere.  The only thing I found\r\nwas a great heap of gold in one corner, gold of all kinds, Roman, and\r\nBritish, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money,\r\ncovered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground.\r\nNone of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old.\r\nThere were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them\r\nold and stained.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt one corner of the room was a heavy door.  I tried it, for, since I\r\ncould not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which\r\nwas the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or\r\nall my efforts would be in vain.  It was open, and led through a stone\r\npassage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI descended, minding carefully where I went for the stairs were dark,\r\nbeing only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry.  At the bottom there\r\nwas a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly\r\nodour, the odour of old earth newly turned.  As I went through the\r\npassage the smell grew closer and heavier.  At last I pulled open a\r\nheavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old ruined chapel,\r\nwhich had evidently been used as a graveyard.  The roof was broken,\r\nand in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had\r\nrecently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes,\r\nmanifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was nobody about, and I made a search over every inch of the\r\nground, so as not to lose a chance.  I went down even into the vaults,\r\nwhere the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my\r\nvery soul.  Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments\r\nof old coffins and piles of dust.  In the third, however, I made a\r\ndiscovery.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on\r\na pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!  He was either dead or\r\nasleep.  I could not say which, for eyes were open and stony, but\r\nwithout the glassiness of death, and the cheeks had the warmth of life\r\nthrough all their pallor.  The lips were as red as ever.  But there\r\nwas no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain.  He\r\ncould not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed\r\naway in a few hours.  By the side of the box was its cover, pierced\r\nwith holes here and there.  I thought he might have the keys on him,\r\nbut when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them dead though\r\nthey were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my\r\npresence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Count''s room by\r\nthe window, crawled again up the castle wall.  Regaining my room, I\r\nthrew myself panting upon the bed and tried to think.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n29 June.--Today is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken\r\nsteps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the\r\ncastle by the same window, and in my clothes.  As he went down the\r\nwall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that\r\nI might destroy him.  But I fear that no weapon wrought along by man''s\r\nhand would have any effect on him.  I dared not wait to see him\r\nreturn, for I feared to see those weird sisters.  I came back to the\r\nlibrary, and read there till I fell asleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man could\r\nlook as he said, "Tomorrow, my friend, we must part.  You return to\r\nyour beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an end that\r\nwe may never meet.  Your letter home has been despatched.  Tomorrow I\r\nshall not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey.  In the\r\nmorning come the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and\r\nalso come some Slovaks.  When they have gone, my carriage shall come\r\nfor you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence\r\nfrom Bukovina to Bistritz.  But I am in hopes that I shall see more of\r\nyou at Castle Dracula."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.  Sincerity!  It\r\nseems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with\r\nsuch a monster, so I asked him point-blank, "Why may I not go\r\ntonight?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But I would walk with pleasure.  I want to get away at once."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was\r\nsome trick behind his smoothness.  He said, "And your baggage?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I do not care about it.  I can send for it some other time."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub\r\nmy eyes, it seemed so real, "You English have a saying which is close\r\nto my heart, for its spirit is that which rules our boyars, ''Welcome\r\nthe coming, speed the parting guest.''  Come with me, my dear young\r\nfriend.  Not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will,\r\nthough sad am I at your going, and that you so suddenly desire it.\r\nCome!"  With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me down\r\nthe stairs and along the hall.  Suddenly he stopped.  "Hark!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves.  It was almost as if\r\nthe sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a\r\ngreat orchestra seems to leap under the baton of the conductor.  After\r\na pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door,\r\ndrew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to\r\ndraw it open.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked.  Suspiciously,\r\nI looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew\r\nlouder and angrier.  Their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their\r\nblunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door.  I\r\nknew than that to struggle at the moment against the Count was\r\nuseless.  With such allies as these at his command, I could do\r\nnothing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count''s body\r\nstood in the gap.  Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment\r\nand means of my doom.  I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own\r\ninstigation.  There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great\r\nenough for the Count, and as the last chance I cried out, "Shut the\r\ndoor!  I shall wait till morning."  And I covered my face with my\r\nhands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and\r\nthe great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back\r\ninto their places.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went\r\nto my own room.  The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his\r\nhand to me, with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile\r\nthat Judas in hell might be proud of.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a\r\nwhispering at my door.  I went to it softly and listened.  Unless my\r\nears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Back!  Back to your own place!  Your time is not yet come.  Wait!\r\nHave patience!  Tonight is mine.  Tomorrow night is yours!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open\r\nthe door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips.\r\nAs I appeared, they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI came back to my room and threw myself on my knees.  It is then so\r\nnear the end?  Tomorrow!  Tomorrow!  Lord, help me, and those to whom\r\nI am dear!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 June.--These may be the last words I ever write in this diary.  I\r\nslept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself on my\r\nknees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the\r\nmorning had come.  Then came the welcome cockcrow, and I felt that I\r\nwas safe.  With a glad heart, I opened the door and ran down the hall.\r\nI had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me.\r\nWith hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and\r\nthrew back the massive bolts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut the door would not move.  Despair seized me.  I pulled and pulled\r\nat the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its\r\ncasement.  I could see the bolt shot.  It had been locked after I left\r\nthe Count.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen a wild desire took me to obtain the key at any risk, and I\r\ndetermined then and there to scale the wall again, and gain the\r\nCount''s room.  He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier\r\nchoice of evils.  Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and\r\nscrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count''s room.  It was\r\nempty, but that was as I expected.  I could not see a key anywhere,\r\nbut the heap of gold remained.  I went through the door in the corner\r\nand down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old\r\nchapel.  I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the\r\nlid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in\r\ntheir places to be hammered home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and\r\nlaid it back against the wall.  And then I saw something which filled\r\nmy very soul with horror.  There lay the Count, but looking as if his\r\nyouth had been half restored.  For the white hair and moustache were\r\nchanged to dark iron-grey.  The cheeks were fuller, and the white skin\r\nseemed ruby-red underneath.  The mouth was redder than ever, for on\r\nthe lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of\r\nthe mouth and ran down over the chin and neck.  Even the deep, burning\r\neyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches\r\nunderneath were bloated.  It seemed as if the whole awful creature\r\nwere simply gorged with blood.  He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted\r\nwith his repletion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me\r\nrevolted at the contact, but I had to search, or I was lost.  The\r\ncoming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar war to those\r\nhorrid three.  I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of\r\nthe key.  Then I stopped and looked at the Count.  There was a mocking\r\nsmile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad.  This was the\r\nbeing I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for\r\ncenturies to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his\r\nlust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of\r\nsemi-demons to batten on the helpless.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe very thought drove me mad.  A terrible desire came upon me to rid\r\nthe world of such a monster.  There was no lethal weapon at hand, but\r\nI seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases,\r\nand lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful\r\nface.  But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell upon me,\r\nwith all their blaze of basilisk horror.  The sight seemed to paralyze\r\nme, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely\r\nmaking a deep gash above the forehead.  The shovel fell from my hand\r\nacross the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught\r\nthe edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing\r\nfrom my sight.  The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,\r\nblood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held\r\nits own in the nethermost hell.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed\r\non fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me.  As I\r\nwaited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices\r\ncoming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and\r\nthe cracking of whips.  The Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count\r\nhad spoken were coming.  With a last look around and at the box which\r\ncontained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count''s\r\nroom, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.\r\nWith strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of\r\nthe key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door.\r\nThere must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key\r\nfor one of the locked doors.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some\r\npassage which sent up a clanging echo.  I turned to run down again\r\ntowards the vault, where I might find the new entrance, but at the\r\nmoment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to\r\nthe winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the\r\nlintels flying.  When I ran to push it open, I found that it was\r\nhopelessly fast.  I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was\r\nclosing round me more closely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet\r\nand the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,\r\nwith their freight of earth.  There was a sound of hammering.  It is\r\nthe box being nailed down.  Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping\r\nagain along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe door is shut, the chains rattle.  There is a grinding of the key\r\nin the lock.  I can hear the key withdrawn, then another door opens\r\nand shuts.  I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHark!  In the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy\r\nwheels, the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass\r\ninto the distance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am alone in the castle with those horrible women.  Faugh!  Mina is a\r\nwoman, and there is nought in common.  They are devils of the Pit!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shall not remain alone with them.  I shall try to scale the castle\r\nwall farther than I have yet attempted.  I shall take some of the gold\r\nwith me, lest I want it later.  I may find a way from this dreadful\r\nplace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then away for home!  Away to the quickest and nearest train!  Away\r\nfrom the cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his\r\nchildren still walk with earthly feet!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt least God''s mercy is better than that of those monsters, and the\r\nprecipice is steep and high.  At its foot a man may sleep, as a man.\r\nGoodbye, all.  Mina!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes\r\ntrying.  I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can\r\ntalk together freely and build our castles in the air.  I have been\r\nworking very hard lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan''s\r\nstudies, and I have been practicing shorthand very assiduously.\r\nWhen we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if\r\nI can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in\r\nthis way and write it out for him on the typewriter, at which also I\r\nam practicing very hard.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is\r\nkeeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad.  When\r\nI am with you I shall keep a diary in the same way.  I don''t\r\nmean one of those two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-\r\nin-a-corner diaries, but a sort of journal which I can write\r\nin whenever I feel inclined.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people, but\r\nit is not intended for them.  I may show it to Jonathan some day if\r\nthere is in it anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise\r\nbook.  I shall try to do what I see lady journalists do,\r\ninterviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember\r\nconversations.  I am told that, with a little practice, one can\r\nremember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, we shall see.  I will tell you of my little plans when we\r\nmeet.  I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from\r\nTransylvania.  He is well, and will be returning in about a week.  I\r\nam longing to hear all his news.  It must be nice to see strange\r\ncountries.  I wonder if we, I mean Jonathan and I, shall ever see\r\nthem together.  There is the ten o''clock bell ringing.  Goodbye.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYour loving\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMina\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTell me all the news when you write.  You have not told me\r\nanything for a long time.  I hear rumours, and especially\r\nof a tall, handsome, curly-haired man???\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n17, Chatham Street\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWednesday\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy dearest Mina,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent.\r\nI wrote you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only\r\nyour second.  Besides, I have nothing to tell you.  There is really\r\nnothing to interest you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTown is very pleasant just now, and we go a great deal to\r\npicture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park.  As\r\nto the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who\r\nwas with me at the last Pop.  Someone has evidently been\r\ntelling tales.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat was Mr. Holmwood.  He often comes to see us, and he and\r\nMamma get on very well together, they have so many things\r\nto talk about in common.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe met some time ago a man that would just do for you, if you were\r\nnot already engaged to Jonathan.  He is an excellent parti, being\r\nhandsome, well off, and of good birth.  He is a doctor and really\r\nclever.  Just fancy!  He is only nine-and twenty, and he has an\r\nimmense lunatic asylum all under his own care.  Mr. Holmwood\r\nintroduced him to me, and he called here to see us, and often comes\r\nnow.  I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet\r\nthe most calm.  He seems absolutely imperturbable.  I can fancy what\r\na wonderful power he must have over his patients.  He has a curious\r\nhabit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read\r\none''s thoughts.  He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter\r\nmyself he has got a tough nut to crack.  I know that from my glass.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDo you ever try to read your own face?  I do, and I can\r\ntell you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble\r\nthan you can well fancy if you have never tried it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe says that I afford him a curious psychological study, and\r\nI humbly think I do.  I do not, as you know, take sufficient\r\ninterest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions.\r\nDress is a bore.  That is slang again, but never mind.  Arthur\r\nsays that every day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere, it is all out, Mina, we have told all our secrets to\r\neach other since we were children.  We have slept together\r\nand eaten together, and laughed and cried together, and\r\nnow, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more.  Oh,\r\nMina, couldn''t you guess?  I love him.  I am blushing as I\r\nwrite, for although I think he loves me, he has not told me\r\nso in words.  But, oh, Mina, I love him.  I love him!  There,\r\nthat does me good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we\r\nused to sit, and I would try to tell you what I feel.  I do not know\r\nhow I am writing this even to you.  I am afraid to stop, or I should\r\ntear up the letter, and I don''t want to stop, for I do so want to\r\ntell you all. Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all that you\r\nthink about it.  Mina, pray for my happiness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nP.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret.\r\nGoodnight again.  L.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n24 May\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy dearest Mina,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter.  It\r\nwas so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy dear, it never rains but it pours.  How true the old proverbs\r\nare.  Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never\r\nhad a proposal till today, not a real proposal, and today I had\r\nthree.  Just fancy!  Three proposals in one day!  Isn''t it awful!  I\r\nfeel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows.\r\nOh, Mina, I am so happy that I don''t know what to do with myself.\r\nAnd three proposals!  But, for goodness'' sake, don''t tell any of the\r\ngirls, or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas, and\r\nimagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day\r\nat home they did not get six at least.  Some girls are so vain!  You\r\nand I, Mina dear, who are engaged and are going to settle down soon\r\nsoberly into old married women, can despise vanity.  Well, I must\r\ntell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from\r\nevery one except, of course, Jonathan.  You will tell him, because I\r\nwould, if I were in your place, certainly tell Arthur.  A woman\r\nought to tell her husband everything.  Don''t you think so, dear?  And\r\nI must be fair.  Men like women, certainly their wives, to be quite\r\nas fair as they are.  And women, I am afraid, are not always quite\r\nas fair as they should be.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWell, my dear, number One came just before lunch.  I told you of\r\nhim, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic asylum man, with the strong jaw\r\nand the good forehead.  He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous\r\nall the same.  He had evidently been schooling himself as to all\r\nsorts of little things, and remembered them, but he almost managed\r\nto sit down on his silk hat, which men don''t generally do when they\r\nare cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing\r\nwith a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream.  He spoke to me,\r\nMina, very straightforwardly.  He told me how dear I was to him,\r\nthough he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me\r\nto help and cheer him.  He was going to tell me how unhappy he would\r\nbe if I did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said he was\r\na brute and would not add to my present trouble.  Then he broke off\r\nand asked if I could love him in time, and when I shook my head his\r\nhands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared\r\nalready for any one else.  He put it very nicely, saying that he did\r\nnot want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know, because\r\nif a woman''s heart was free a man might have hope.  And then, Mina,\r\nI felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one.  I only\r\ntold him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very strong\r\nand very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I\r\nwould be happy, and that If I ever wanted a friend I must count him\r\none of my best.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOh, Mina dear, I can''t help crying, and you must excuse this letter\r\nbeing all blotted.  Being proposed to is all very nice and all that\r\nsort of thing, but it isn''t at all a happy thing when you have to\r\nsee a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, going away and\r\nlooking all broken hearted, and to know that, no matter what he may\r\nsay at the moment, you are passing out of his life.  My dear, I must\r\nstop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEvening.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I\r\nleft off, so I can go on telling you about the day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWell, my dear, number Two came after lunch.  He is such a nice\r\nfellow, an American from Texas, and he looks so young and so fresh\r\nthat it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places\r\nand has such adventures.  I sympathize with poor Desdemona when she\r\nhad such a stream poured in her ear, even by a black man.  I suppose\r\nthat we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from\r\nfears, and we marry him.  I know now what I would do if I were a man\r\nand wanted to make a girl love me.  No, I don''t, for there was Mr.\r\nMorris telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any, and\r\nyet&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy dear, I am somewhat previous.  Mr. Quincy P. Morris found me\r\nalone.  It seems that a man always does find a girl alone.  No, he\r\ndoesn''t, for Arthur tried twice to make a chance, and I helping him\r\nall I could, I am not ashamed to say it now.  I must tell you\r\nbeforehand that Mr. Morris doesn''t always speak slang, that is to\r\nsay, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really\r\nwell educated and has exquisite manners, but he found out that it\r\namused me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was\r\npresent, and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny\r\nthings.  I am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits\r\nexactly into whatever else he has to say.  But this is a way slang\r\nhas.  I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang.  I do not\r\nknow if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him use any as yet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWell, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as\r\nhe could, but I could see all the same that he was very nervous.  He\r\ntook my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Miss Lucy, I know I ain''t good enough to regulate the fixin''s of\r\nyour little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that\r\nis you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you\r\nquit.  Won''t you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down\r\nthe long road together, driving in double harness?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWell, he did look so good humoured and so jolly that it didn''t seem\r\nhalf so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward.  So I said, as\r\nlightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and\r\nthat I wasn''t broken to harness at all yet.  Then he said that he\r\nhad spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a\r\nmistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, and occasion for him,\r\nI would forgive him.  He really did look serious when he was saying\r\nit, and I couldn''t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was\r\nnumber Two in one day.  And then, my dear, before I could say a word\r\nhe began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his\r\nvery heart and soul at my feet.  He looked so earnest over it that I\r\nshall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never\r\nearnest, because he is merry at times.  I suppose he saw something\r\nin my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with\r\na sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had\r\nbeen free&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Lucy, you are an honest hearted girl, I know.  I should not be here\r\nspeaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit,\r\nright through to the very depths of your soul.  Tell me, like one\r\ngood fellow to another, is there any one else that you care for?\r\nAnd if there is I''ll never trouble you a hair''s breadth again, but\r\nwill be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little\r\nworthy of them?  Here was I almost making fun of this great hearted,\r\ntrue gentleman.  I burst into tears, I am afraid, my dear, you will\r\nthink this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one, and I really\r\nfelt very badly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhy can''t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as\r\nwant her, and save all this trouble?  But this is heresy,\r\nand I must not say it.  I am glad to say that, though I was\r\ncrying, I was able to look into Mr. Morris'' brave eyes, and\r\nI told him out straight&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me\r\nyet that he even loves me."  I was right to speak to him so\r\nfrankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put\r\nout both his hands and took mine, I think I put them into\r\nhis, and said in a hearty way&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That''s my brave girl.  It''s better worth being late for a chance of\r\nwinning you than being in time for any other girl in the world.\r\nDon''t cry, my dear.  If it''s for me, I''m a hard nut to crack, and I\r\ntake it standing up.  If that other fellow doesn''t know his\r\nhappiness, well, he''d better look for it soon, or he''ll have to deal\r\nwith me.  Little girl, your honesty and pluck have made me a friend,\r\nand that''s rarer than a lover, it''s more selfish anyhow.  My dear,\r\nI''m going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom\r\nCome.  Won''t you give me one kiss?  It''ll be something to keep off\r\nthe darkness now and then.  You can, you know, if you like, for that\r\nother good fellow, or you could not love him, hasn''t spoken yet."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweet of him,\r\nand noble too, to a rival, wasn''t it?  And he so sad, so I\r\nleant over and kissed him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down into my\r\nface, I am afraid I was blushing very much, he said, "Little girl, I\r\nhold your hand, and you''ve kissed me, and if these things don''t make\r\nus friends nothing ever will.  Thank you for your sweet honesty to\r\nme, and goodbye."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight out of the\r\nroom without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause,\r\nand I am crying like a baby.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of\r\ngirls about who would worship the very ground he trod on?  I know I\r\nwould if I were free, only I don''t want to be free.  My dear, this\r\nquite upset me, and I feel I cannot write of happiness just at once,\r\nafter telling you of it, and I don''t wish to tell of the number\r\nThree until it can be all happy.  Ever your loving&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nP.S.--Oh, about number Three, I needn''t tell you of number\r\nThree, need I?  Besides, it was all so confused.  It seemed\r\nonly a moment from his coming into the room till both his\r\narms were round me, and he was kissing me.  I am very, very\r\nhappy, and I don''t know what I have done to deserve it.  I\r\nmust only try in the future to show that I am not ungrateful\r\nto God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a\r\nlover, such a husband, and such a friend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGoodbye.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR.

Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty\r\nfeeling.  Nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be\r\nworth the doing.  As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing\r\nwas work, I went amongst the patients.  I picked out one who has\r\nafforded me a study of much interest.  He is so quaint that I am\r\ndetermined to understand him as well as I can.  Today I seemed to get\r\nnearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to\r\nmaking myself master of the facts of his hallucination.  In my manner\r\nof doing it there was, I now see, something of cruelty.  I seemed to\r\nwish to keep him to the point of his madness, a thing which I avoid\r\nwith the patients as I would the mouth of hell.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(Mem., Under what circumstances would I not avoid the pit of hell?)\r\nOmnia Romae venalia sunt.  Hell has its price!

I presume that the sanguine temperament\r\nitself and the disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished\r\nfinish, a possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish.  In\r\nselfish men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for\r\nthemselves.  What I think of on this point is, when self is the fixed\r\npoint the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal.  When\r\nduty, a cause, etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is\r\nparamount, and only accident or a series of accidents can balance it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, QUINCEY P.

Whitby.--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and\r\nlovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in\r\nwhich they have rooms.  This is a lovely place.  The little river, the\r\nEsk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near\r\nthe harbour.  A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through\r\nwhich the view seems somehow further away than it really is.  The\r\nvalley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on\r\nthe high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are\r\nnear enough to see down.  The houses of the old town--the side away\r\nfrom us, are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other\r\nanyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg.  Right over the town is\r\nthe ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is\r\nthe scene of part of "Marmion," where the girl was built up in the\r\nwall.  It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful\r\nand romantic bits.  There is a legend that a white lady is seen in one\r\nof the windows.  Between it and the town there is another church, the\r\nparish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones.\r\nThis is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over\r\nthe town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to\r\nwhere the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea.  It\r\ndescends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen\r\naway, and some of the graves have been destroyed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over\r\nthe sandy pathway far below.  There are walks, with seats beside them,\r\nthrough the churchyard, and people go and sit there all day long\r\nlooking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shall come and sit here often myself and work.  Indeed, I am writing\r\nnow, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old\r\nmen who are sitting beside me.  They seem to do nothing all day but\r\nsit here and talk.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite\r\nwall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of\r\nit, in the middle of which is a lighthouse.  A heavy seawall runs\r\nalong outside of it.  On the near side, the seawall makes an elbow\r\ncrooked inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse.  Between the two\r\npiers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly\r\nwidens.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is nice at high water, but when the tide is out it shoals away to\r\nnothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between\r\nbanks of sand, with rocks here and there.  Outside the harbour on this\r\nside there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp of\r\nwhich runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse.  At the end\r\nof it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in\r\na mournful sound on the wind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at\r\nsea.  I must ask the old man about this.  He is coming this way&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe is a funny old man.  He must be awfully old, for his face is\r\ngnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree.  He tells me that he is\r\nnearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing\r\nfleet when Waterloo was fought.  He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical\r\nperson, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady\r\nat the abbey he said very brusquely,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I wouldn''t fash masel'' about them, miss.  Them things be all wore\r\nout.  Mind, I don''t say that they never was, but I do say that they\r\nwasn''t in my time.  They be all very well for comers and trippers, an''\r\nthe like, but not for a nice young lady like you.  Them feet-folks\r\nfrom York and Leeds that be always eatin'' cured herrin''s and drinkin''\r\ntea an'' lookin'' out to buy cheap jet would creed aught.  I wonder\r\nmasel'' who''d be bothered tellin'' lies to them, even the newspapers,\r\nwhich is full of fool-talk."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from,\r\nso I asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whale\r\nfishing in the old days.  He was just settling himself to begin when\r\nthe clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss.  My grand-daughter doesn''t\r\nlike to be kept waitin'' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to\r\ncrammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of ''em, and miss, I lack\r\nbelly-timber sairly by the clock."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could,\r\ndown the steps.  The steps are a great feature on the place.  They\r\nlead from the town to the church, there are hundreds of them, I do not\r\nknow how many, and they wind up in a delicate curve.  The slope is so\r\ngentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey.\r\nI shall go home too.  Lucy went out, visiting with her mother, and as\r\nthey were only duty calls, I did not go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 August.--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most\r\ninteresting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come\r\nand join him.  He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should\r\nthink must have been in his time a most dictatorial person.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe will not admit anything, and down faces everybody.  If he can''t\r\nout-argue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for\r\nagreement with his views.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock.  She has got\r\na beautiful colour since she has been here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming and sitting\r\nnear her when we sat down.  She is so sweet with old people, I think\r\nthey all fell in love with her on the spot.  Even my old man succumbed\r\nand did not contradict her, but gave me double share instead.  I got\r\nhim on the subject of the legends, and he went off at once into a sort\r\nof sermon.  I must try to remember it and put it down.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel, that''s what it be and\r\nnowt else.  These bans an'' wafts an'' boh-ghosts an'' bar-guests an''\r\nbogles an'' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an'' dizzy women\r\na''belderin''.  They be nowt but air-blebs.  They, an'' all grims an'' signs\r\nan'' warnin''s, be all invented by parsons an'' illsome berk-bodies an''\r\nrailway touters to skeer an'' scunner hafflin''s, an'' to get folks to do\r\nsomethin'' that they don''t other incline to.  It makes me ireful to\r\nthink o'' them.  Why, it''s them that, not content with printin'' lies on\r\npaper an'' preachin'' them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin'' them\r\non the tombstones.  Look here all around you in what airt ye will.  All\r\nthem steans, holdin'' up their heads as well as they can out of their\r\npride, is acant, simply tumblin'' down with the weight o'' the lies\r\nwrote on them, ''Here lies the body'' or ''Sacred to the memory'' wrote on\r\nall of them, an'' yet in nigh half of them there bean''t no bodies at\r\nall, an'' the memories of them bean''t cared a pinch of snuff about,\r\nmuch less sacred.  Lies all of them, nothin'' but lies of one kind or\r\nanother!  My gog, but it''ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of\r\nJudgment when they come tumblin'' up in their death-sarks, all jouped\r\ntogether an'' trying'' to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how\r\ngood they was, some of them trimmlin'' an'' dithering, with their hands\r\nthat dozzened an'' slippery from lyin'' in the sea that they can''t even\r\nkeep their gurp o'' them."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could see from the old fellow''s self-satisfied air and the way in\r\nwhich he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was\r\n"showing off," so I put in a word to keep him going.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can''t be serious.  Surely these tombstones are\r\nnot all wrong?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yabblins!  There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin'' where they\r\nmake out the people too good, for there be folk that do think a\r\nbalm-bowl be like the sea, if only it be their own.  The whole thing\r\nbe only lies.  Now look you here.  You come here a stranger, an'' you\r\nsee this kirkgarth."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite\r\nunderstand his dialect.  I knew it had something to do with the\r\nchurch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe went on, "And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that\r\nbe haped here, snod an'' snog?"  I assented again.  "Then that be just\r\nwhere the lie comes in.  Why, there be scores of these laybeds that be\r\ntoom as old Dun''s ''baccabox on Friday night."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed.  "And, my gog!\r\nHow could they be otherwise?  Look at that one, the aftest abaft the\r\nbier-bank, read it!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went over and read, "Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by\r\npirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, age 30."  When I came\r\nback Mr. Swales went on,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here?  Murdered off the\r\ncoast of Andres!  An'' you consated his body lay under!  Why, I could\r\nname ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above," he\r\npointed northwards, "or where the currants may have drifted them.\r\nThere be the steans around ye.  Ye can, with your young eyes, read the\r\nsmall print of the lies from here.  This Braithwaite Lowery, I knew\r\nhis father, lost in the Lively off Greenland in ''20, or Andrew\r\nWoodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777, or John Paxton, drowned\r\noff Cape Farewell a year later, or old John Rawlings, whose\r\ngrandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in ''50.  Do\r\nye think that all these men will have to make a rush to Whitby when\r\nthe trumpet sounds?  I have me antherums aboot it!  I tell ye that\r\nwhen they got here they''d be jommlin'' and jostlin'' one another that\r\nway that it ''ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days, when\r\nwe''d be at one another from daylight to dark, an'' tryin'' to tie up our\r\ncuts by the aurora borealis."  This was evidently local pleasantry, for\r\nthe old man cackled over it, and his cronies joined in with gusto.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But," I said, "surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the\r\nassumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to\r\ntake their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment.  Do you think\r\nthat will be really necessary?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, what else be they tombstones for?  Answer me that, miss!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"To please their relatives, I suppose."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"To please their relatives, you suppose!"  This he said with intense\r\nscorn.  "How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is\r\nwrote over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be\r\nlies?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab,\r\non which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff.  "Read\r\nthe lies on that thruff-stone," he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe letters were upside down to me from where I sat, but Lucy was more\r\nopposite to them, so she leant over and read, "Sacred to the memory of\r\nGeorge Canon, who died, in the hope of a glorious resurrection, on\r\nJuly 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at Kettleness.  This tomb was\r\nerected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son.  ''He was the\r\nonly son of his mother, and she was a widow.''  Really, Mr. Swales, I\r\ndon''t see anything very funny in that!"  She spoke her comment very\r\ngravely and somewhat severely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Ye don''t see aught funny!  Ha-ha!  But that''s because ye don''t gawm\r\nthe sorrowin'' mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was\r\nacrewk''d, a regular lamiter he was, an'' he hated her so that he\r\ncommitted suicide in order that she mightn''t get an insurance she put\r\non his life.  He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket\r\nthat they had for scarin'' crows with.  ''Twarn''t for crows then, for it\r\nbrought the clegs and the dowps to him.  That''s the way he fell off\r\nthe rocks.  And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I''ve often\r\nheard him say masel'' that he hoped he''d go to hell, for his mother was\r\nso pious that she''d be sure to go to heaven, an'' he didn''t want to\r\naddle where she was.  Now isn''t that stean at any rate," he hammered\r\nit with his stick as he spoke, "a pack of lies?  And won''t it make\r\nGabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin'' ut the grees with the\r\ntompstean balanced on his hump, and asks to be took as evidence!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she\r\nsaid, rising up, "Oh, why did you tell us of this?  It is my favourite\r\nseat, and I cannot leave it, and now I find I must go on sitting over\r\nthe grave of a suicide."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That won''t harm ye, my pretty, an'' it may make poor Geordie gladsome\r\nto have so trim a lass sittin'' on his lap.  That won''t hurt ye.  Why,\r\nI''ve sat here off an'' on for nigh twenty years past, an'' it hasn''t\r\ndone me no harm.  Don''t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that\r\ndoesn'' lie there either!  It''ll be time for ye to be getting scart\r\nwhen ye see the tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as\r\na stubble-field.  There''s the clock, and I must gang.  My service to\r\nye, ladies!"  And off he hobbled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we\r\ntook hands as we sat, and she told me all over again about Arthur and\r\ntheir coming marriage.  That made me just a little heart-sick, for I\r\nhaven''t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe same day.  I came up here alone, for I am very sad.  There was no\r\nletter for me.  I hope there cannot be anything the matter with\r\nJonathan.  The clock has just struck nine.  I see the lights scattered\r\nall over the town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and\r\nsometimes singly.  They run right up the Esk and die away in the curve\r\nof the valley.  To my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof\r\nof the old house next to the abbey.  The sheep and lambs are bleating\r\nin the fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of donkeys'' hoofs\r\nup the paved road below.  The band on the pier is playing a harsh\r\nwaltz in good time, and further along the quay there is a Salvation\r\nArmy meeting in a back street.  Neither of the bands hears the other,\r\nbut up here I hear and see them both.  I wonder where Jonathan is and\r\nif he is thinking of me!  I wish he were here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n5 June.--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to\r\nunderstand the man.  He has certain qualities very largely developed,\r\nselfishness, secrecy, and purpose.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI wish I could get at what is the object of the latter.  He seems to\r\nhave some settled scheme of his own, but what it is I do not know.\r\nHis redeeming quality is a love of animals, though, indeed, he has\r\nsuch curious turns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only\r\nabnormally cruel.  His pets are of odd sorts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust now his hobby is catching flies.  He has at present such a\r\nquantity that I have had myself to expostulate.  To my astonishment,\r\nhe did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter\r\nin simple seriousness.  He thought for a moment, and then said, "May I\r\nhave three days?  I shall clear them away."  Of course, I said that\r\nwould do.  I must watch him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n18 June.--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several\r\nvery big fellows in a box.  He keeps feeding them his flies, and the\r\nnumber of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he has\r\nused half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 July.--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his\r\nflies, and today I told him that he must get rid of them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked very sad at this, so I said that he must some of them, at\r\nall events.  He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same\r\ntime as before for reduction.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid blowfly,\r\nbloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it,\r\nheld it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb, and\r\nbefore I knew what he was going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was very good and\r\nvery wholesome, that it was life, strong life, and gave life to him.\r\nThis gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one.  I must watch how he\r\ngets rid of his spiders.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps a little\r\nnotebook in which he is always jotting down something.  Whole pages of\r\nit are filled with masses of figures, generally single numbers added\r\nup in batches, and then the totals added in batches again, as though\r\nhe were focussing some account, as the auditors put it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n8 July.--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in\r\nmy mind is growing.  It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,\r\nunconscious cerebration, you will have to give the wall to your\r\nconscious brother.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I might notice if\r\nthere were any change.  Things remain as they were except that he has\r\nparted with some of his pets and got a new one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it.\r\nHis means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have\r\ndiminished.  Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for he still\r\nbrings in the flies by tempting them with his food.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n19 July--We are progressing.  My friend has now a whole colony of\r\nsparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated.  When I\r\ncame in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour, a\r\nvery, very great favour.  And as he spoke, he fawned on me like a dog.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his\r\nvoice and bearing, "A kitten, a nice, little, sleek playful kitten,\r\nthat I can play with, and teach, and feed, and feed, and feed!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was not unprepared for this request, for I had noticed how his pets\r\nwent on increasing in size and vivacity, but I did not care that his\r\npretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner\r\nas the flies and spiders.  So I said I would see about it, and asked\r\nhim if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis eagerness betrayed him as he answered, "Oh, yes, I would like a\r\ncat!  I only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat.  No\r\none would refuse me a kitten, would they?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shook my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be\r\npossible, but that I would see about it.  His face fell, and I could\r\nsee a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong\r\nlook which meant killing.  The man is an undeveloped homicidal\r\nmaniac.  I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will\r\nwork out, then I shall know more.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n10 pm.--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner\r\nbrooding.  When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and\r\nimplored me to let him have a cat, that his salvation depended upon\r\nit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon\r\nhe went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the\r\ncorner where I had found him.  I shall see him in the morning early.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n20 July.--Visited Renfield very early, before attendant went his\r\nrounds.  Found him up and humming a tune.  He was spreading out his\r\nsugar, which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning\r\nhis fly catching again, and beginning it cheerfully and with a good\r\ngrace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where\r\nthey were.  He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown\r\naway.  There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a\r\ndrop of blood.  I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report\r\nto me if there were anything odd about him during the day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n11 am.--The attendant has just been to see me to say that Renfield has\r\nbeen very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers.  "My belief\r\nis, doctor," he said, "that he has eaten his birds, and that he just\r\ntook and ate them raw!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n11 pm.--I gave Renfield a strong opiate tonight, enough to make even\r\nhim sleep, and took away his pocketbook to look at it.  The thought\r\nthat has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the\r\ntheory proved.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind.  I shall have to invent a\r\nnew classification for him, and call him a zoophagous (life-eating)\r\nmaniac.  What he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he\r\nhas laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way.  He gave many\r\nflies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a\r\ncat to eat the many birds.  What would have been his later steps?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt would almost be worth while to complete the experiment.  It might\r\nbe done if there were only a sufficient cause.  Men sneered at\r\nvivisection, and yet look at its results today!  Why not advance\r\nscience in its most difficult and vital aspect, the knowledge of the\r\nbrain?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHad I even the secret of one such mind, did I hold the key to the\r\nfancy of even one lunatic, I might advance my own branch of science to\r\na pitch compared with which Burdon-Sanderson''s physiology or Ferrier''s\r\nbrain knowledge would be as nothing.  If only there were a sufficient\r\ncause!  I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted.  A\r\ngood cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an\r\nexceptional brain, congenitally?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHow well the man reasoned.  Lunatics always do within their own scope.\r\nI wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one.  He has\r\nclosed the account most accurately, and today begun a new record.  How\r\nmany of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new\r\nhope, and that truly I began a new record.  So it shall be until the\r\nGreat Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance\r\nto profit or loss.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry with my\r\nfriend whose happiness is yours, but I must only wait on hopeless and\r\nwork.  Work!  Work!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf I could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there, a good,\r\nunselfish cause to make me work, that would be indeed happiness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA MURRAY''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n26 July.--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here.  It\r\nis like whispering to one''s self and listening at the same time.  And\r\nthere is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it\r\ndifferent from writing.  I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan.\r\nI had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned,\r\nbut yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a\r\nletter from him.  I had written asking him if he had heard, and he\r\nsaid the enclosed had just been received.  It is only a line dated\r\nfrom Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home.  That\r\nis not like Jonathan.  I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen, too, Lucy, although she is so well, has lately taken to her old\r\nhabit of walking in her sleep.  Her mother has spoken to me about it,\r\nand we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room every\r\nnight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on\r\nroofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly\r\nwakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the\r\nplace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPoor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that\r\nher husband, Lucy''s father, had the same habit, that he would get up\r\nin the night and dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already planning out\r\nher dresses and how her house is to be arranged.  I sympathise with\r\nher, for I do the same, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a\r\nvery simple way, and shall have to try to make both ends meet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Holmwood, he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord\r\nGodalming, is coming up here very shortly, as soon as he can leave\r\ntown, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is\r\ncounting the moments till he comes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe wants to take him up in the seat on the churchyard cliff and show\r\nhim the beauty of Whitby.  I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs\r\nher.  She will be all right when he arrives.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n27 July.--No news from Jonathan.  I am getting quite uneasy about him,\r\nthough why I should I do not know, but I do wish that he would write,\r\nif it were only a single line.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened by her moving\r\nabout the room.  Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot\r\nget cold.  But still, the anxiety and the perpetually being awakened\r\nis beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and wakeful\r\nmyself.  Thank God, Lucy''s health keeps up.  Mr. Holmwood has been\r\nsuddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken\r\nseriously ill.  Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it\r\ndoes not touch her looks.  She is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are\r\na lovely rose-pink.  She has lost the anemic look which she had.  I\r\npray it will all last.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3 August.--Another week gone by, and no news from Jonathan, not even\r\nto Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard.  Oh, I do hope he is not ill.\r\nHe surely would have written.  I look at that last letter of his, but\r\nsomehow it does not satisfy me.  It does not read like him, and yet it\r\nis his writing.  There is no mistake of that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week, but there is an\r\nodd concentration about her which I do not understand, even in her\r\nsleep she seems to be watching me.  She tries the door, and finding it\r\nlocked, goes about the room searching for the key.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n6 August.--Another three days, and no news.  This suspense is getting\r\ndreadful.  If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I\r\nshould feel easier.  But no one has heard a word of Jonathan since\r\nthat last letter.  I must only pray to God for patience.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well.  Last night\r\nwas very threatening, and the fishermen say that we are in for a\r\nstorm.  I must try to watch it and learn the weather signs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nToday is a gray day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds,\r\nhigh over Kettleness.  Everything is gray except the green grass,\r\nwhich seems like emerald amongst it, gray earthy rock, gray clouds,\r\ntinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the gray sea, into\r\nwhich the sandpoints stretch like gray figures.  The sea is tumbling\r\nin over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the\r\nsea-mists drifting inland.  The horizon is lost in a gray mist.  All\r\nvastness, the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a\r\n''brool'' over the sea that sounds like some passage of doom.  Dark\r\nfigures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in\r\nthe mist, and seem ''men like trees walking''.  The fishing boats are\r\nracing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep\r\ninto the harbour, bending to the scuppers.  Here comes old Mr. Swales.\r\nHe is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his\r\nhat, that he wants to talk.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man.  When he\r\nsat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way, "I want to say\r\nsomething to you, miss."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in\r\nmine and asked him to speak fully.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo he said, leaving his hand in mine, "I''m afraid, my deary, that I\r\nmust have shocked you by all the wicked things I''ve been sayin'' about\r\nthe dead, and such like, for weeks past, but I didn''t mean them, and I\r\nwant ye to remember that when I''m gone.  We aud folks that be daffled,\r\nand with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don''t altogether like to think\r\nof it, and we don''t want to feel scart of it, and that''s why I''ve took\r\nto makin'' light of it, so that I''d cheer up my own heart a bit.  But,\r\nLord love ye, miss, I ain''t afraid of dyin'', not a bit, only I don''t\r\nwant to die if I can help it.  My time must be nigh at hand now, for I\r\nbe aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect.  And\r\nI''m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin'' his scythe.  Ye\r\nsee, I can''t get out o'' the habit of caffin'' about it all at once.\r\nThe chafts will wag as they be used to.  Some day soon the Angel of\r\nDeath will sound his trumpet for me.  But don''t ye dooal an'' greet, my\r\ndeary!"--for he saw that I was crying--"if he should come this very\r\nnight I''d not refuse to answer his call.  For life be, after all, only\r\na waitin'' for somethin'' else than what we''re doin'', and death be all\r\nthat we can rightly depend on.  But I''m content, for it''s comin'' to\r\nme, my deary, and comin'' quick.  It may be comin'' while we be lookin''\r\nand wonderin''.  Maybe it''s in that wind out over the sea that''s\r\nbringin'' with it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts.\r\nLook!  Look!" he cried suddenly.  "There''s something in that wind and\r\nin the hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells\r\nlike death.  It''s in the air.  I feel it comin''.  Lord, make me answer\r\ncheerful, when my call comes!"  He held up his arms devoutly, and\r\nraised his hat.  His mouth moved as though he were praying.  After a\r\nfew minutes'' silence, he got up, shook hands with me, and blessed me,\r\nand said goodbye, and hobbled off.  It all touched me, and upset me\r\nvery much.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spyglass under his\r\narm.  He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time\r\nkept looking at a strange ship.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I can''t make her out," he said.  "She''s a Russian, by the look of\r\nher.  But she''s knocking about in the queerest way.  She doesn''t know\r\nher mind a bit.  She seems to see the storm coming, but can''t decide\r\nwhether to run up north in the open, or to put in here.  Look there\r\nagain!  She is steered mighty strangely, for she doesn''t mind the hand\r\non the wheel, changes about with every puff of wind.  We''ll hear more\r\nof her before this time tomorrow."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n');

The weather\r\nhad been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the\r\nmonth of August.  Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known,\r\nand the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits\r\nto Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood''s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes,\r\nand the various trips in the neighborhood of Whitby.  The steamers\r\nEmma and Scarborough made trips up and down the coast, and there was\r\nan unusual amount of ''tripping'' both to and from Whitby.  The day\r\nwas unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who\r\nfrequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from the commanding eminence\r\nwatch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called\r\nattention to a sudden show of ''mares tails'' high in the sky to the\r\nnorthwest.  The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the\r\nmild degree which in barometrical language is ranked ''No. 2, light\r\nbreeze.''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman,\r\nwho for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs\r\nfrom the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a\r\nsudden storm.  The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so\r\ngrand in its masses of splendidly coloured clouds, that there was\r\nquite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old\r\nchurchyard to enjoy the beauty.  Before the sun dipped below the\r\nblack mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky,\r\nits downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset colour,\r\nflame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold, with\r\nhere and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute\r\nblackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal\r\nsilhouettes.  The experience was not lost on the painters, and\r\ndoubtless some of the sketches of the ''Prelude to the Great Storm''\r\nwill grace the R. A and R. I. walls in May next.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMore than one captain made up his mind then and there that his\r\n''cobble'' or his ''mule'', as they term the different classes of boats,\r\nwould remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.  The wind\r\nfell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a\r\ndead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on\r\nthe approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting\r\nsteamers, which usually hug the shore so closely, kept well to\r\nseaward, and but few fishing boats were in sight.  The only sail\r\nnoticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was\r\nseemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her\r\nofficers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in\r\nsight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in the\r\nface of her danger.  Before the night shut down she was seen with\r\nsails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of\r\nthe sea.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShortly before ten o''clock the stillness of the air grew quite\r\noppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a\r\nsheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly\r\nheard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was\r\nlike a dischord in the great harmony of nature''s silence.  A little\r\nafter midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high\r\noverhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen without warning the tempest broke.  With a rapidity which, at\r\nthe time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to\r\nrealize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed.  The\r\nwaves rose in growing fury, each over-topping its fellow, till in a\r\nvery few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and\r\ndevouring monster.  White-crested waves beat madly on the level\r\nsands and rushed up the shelving cliffs.  Others broke over the\r\npiers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses\r\nwhich rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was\r\nwith difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with\r\ngrim clasp to the iron stanchions.  It was found necessary to clear\r\nthe entire pier from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities\r\nof the night would have increased manifold.  To add to the\r\ndifficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came\r\ndrifting inland.  White, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly\r\nfashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort\r\nof imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were\r\ntouching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and\r\nmany a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be\r\nseen in the glare of the lightning, which came thick and fast,\r\nfollowed by such peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed\r\ntrembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSome of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and\r\nof absorbing interest.  The sea, running mountains high, threw\r\nskywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the\r\ntempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space.  Here and\r\nthere a fishing boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter\r\nbefore the blast, now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed\r\nseabird.  On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was\r\nready for experiment, but had not yet been tried.  The officers in\r\ncharge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of\r\nonrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.  Once or twice\r\nits service was most effective, as when a fishing boat, with gunwale\r\nunder water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the\r\nsheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers.\r\nAs each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of\r\njoy from the mass of people on the shore, a shout which for a moment\r\nseemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner\r\nwith all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been\r\nnoticed earlier in the evening.  The wind had by this time backed to\r\nthe east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff\r\nas they realized the terrible danger in which she now was.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBetween her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many\r\ngood ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind\r\nblowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that\r\nshe should fetch the entrance of the harbour.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great\r\nthat in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible,\r\nand the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed\r\nthat, in the words of one old salt, "she must fetch up somewhere, if\r\nit was only in hell".  Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater\r\nthan any hitherto, a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all\r\nthings like a gray pall, and left available to men only the organ of\r\nhearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder,\r\nand the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion\r\neven louder than before.  The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed\r\non the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was\r\nexpected, and men waited breathless.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, and the remnant of the\r\nsea fog melted in the blast.  And then, mirabile dictu, between the\r\npiers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,\r\nswept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and\r\ngained the safety of the harbour.  The searchlight followed her, and\r\na shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a\r\ncorpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each\r\nmotion of the ship.  No other form could be seen on the deck at all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a\r\nmiracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead\r\nman!  However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write\r\nthese words.  The schooner paused not, but rushing across the\r\nharbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel\r\nwashed by many tides and many storms into the southeast corner of\r\nthe pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill\r\nPier.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up\r\non the sand heap.  Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some\r\nof the ''top-hammer'' came crashing down.  But, strangest of all, the\r\nvery instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck\r\nfrom below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward,\r\njumped from the bow on the sand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMaking straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over\r\nthe laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat\r\ntombstones, thruffsteans or through-stones, as they call them in\r\nWhitby vernacular, actually project over where the sustaining cliff\r\nhas fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed\r\nintensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill\r\nPier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either\r\nin bed or were out on the heights above.  Thus the coastguard on\r\nduty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the\r\nlittle pier, was the first to climb aboard.  The men working the\r\nsearchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without\r\nseeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it\r\nthere.  The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel,\r\nbent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some\r\nsudden emotion.  This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a\r\nnumber of people began to run.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Draw-bridge to\r\nTate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and\r\ncame well ahead of the crowd.  When I arrived, however, I found\r\nalready assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and\r\npolice refused to allow to come on board.  By the courtesy of the\r\nchief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on\r\ndeck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst\r\nactually lashed to the wheel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed,\r\nfor not often can such a sight have been seen.  The man was simply\r\nfastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the\r\nwheel.  Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set\r\nof beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and\r\nwheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords.  The poor fellow may\r\nhave been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the\r\nsails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and had dragged him\r\nto and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the\r\nflesh to the bone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAccurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor, Surgeon\r\nJ. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place, who came immediately after\r\nme, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been\r\ndead for quite two days.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for\r\na little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to\r\nthe log.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands,\r\nfastening the knots with his teeth.  The fact that a coastguard was\r\nthe first on board may save some complications later on, in the\r\nAdmiralty Court, for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is\r\nthe right of the first civilian entering on a derelict.  Already,\r\nhowever, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is\r\nloudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely\r\nsacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statues\r\nof mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of\r\ndelegated possession, is held in a dead hand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently\r\nremoved from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward\r\ntill death, a steadfastness as noble as that of the young\r\nCasabianca, and placed in the mortuary to await inquest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlready the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is\r\nabating.  Crowds are scattering backward, and the sky is\r\nbeginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shall send, in time for your next issue, further details\r\nof the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously\r\ninto harbour in the storm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n9 August.--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the\r\nstorm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself.  It\r\nturns out that the schooner is Russian from Varna, and is called the\r\nDemeter.  She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with\r\nonly a small amount of cargo, a number of great wooden boxes filled\r\nwith mould.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S.F. Billington,\r\nof 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and took formal\r\npossession of the goods consigned to him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal\r\npossession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNothing is talked about here today except the strange coincidence.\r\nThe officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in\r\nseeing that every compliance has been made with existing\r\nregulations.  As the matter is to be a ''nine days wonder'', they are\r\nevidently determined that there shall be no cause of other\r\ncomplaint.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed\r\nwhen the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the\r\nS.P.C.A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the\r\nanimal.  To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be\r\nfound.  It seems to have disappeared entirely from the town.  It may\r\nbe that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it\r\nis still hiding in terror.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later\r\non it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce\r\nbrute.  Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff\r\nbelonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead\r\nin the roadway opposite its master''s yard.  It had been fighting,\r\nand manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn\r\naway, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been\r\npermitted to look over the log book of the Demeter, which was in\r\norder up to within three days, but contained nothing of special\r\ninterest except as to facts of missing men.  The greatest interest,\r\nhowever, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was\r\ntoday produced at the inquest.  And a more strange narrative than\r\nthe two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them,\r\nand accordingly send you a transcript, simply omitting technical\r\ndetails of seamanship and supercargo.  It almost seems as though the\r\ncaptain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got\r\nwell into blue water, and that this had developed persistently\r\nthroughout the voyage.  Of course my statement must be taken cum\r\ngrano, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the\r\nRussian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  LOG OF THE "DEMETER" Varna to Whitby<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall<br>\r\n  keep accurate note henceforth till we land.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes<br>\r\n  of earth.  At noon set sail.  East wind, fresh.  Crew, five<br>\r\n  hands&#8230; two mates, cook, and myself, (captain).<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus.  Boarded by Turkish<br>\r\n  Customs officers.  Backsheesh.  All correct.  Under way at<br>\r\n  4 p.m.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  On 12 July through Dardanelles.  More Customs officers and<br>\r\n  flagboat of guarding squadron.  Backsheesh again.  Work of<br>\r\n  officers thorough, but quick.  Want us off soon.  At dark<br>\r\n  passed into Archipelago.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  On 13 July passed Cape Matapan.  Crew dissatisfied about<br>\r\n  something.  Seemed scared, but would not speak out.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew.  Men all steady<br>\r\n  fellows, who sailed with me before.  Mate could not make out what<br>\r\n  was wrong.  They only told him there was SOMETHING, and crossed<br>\r\n  themselves.  Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck<br>\r\n  him.  Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of the<br>\r\n  crew, Petrofsky, was missing.  Could not account for it.<br>\r\n  Took larboard watch eight bells last night, was relieved by<br>\r\n  Amramoff, but did not go to bunk.  Men more downcast than<br>\r\n  ever.  All said they expected something of the kind, but<br>\r\n  would not say more than there was SOMETHING aboard.  Mate<br>\r\n  getting very impatient with them.  Feared some trouble<br>\r\n  ahead.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin,<br>\r\n  and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a<br>\r\n  strange man aboard the ship.  He said that in his watch he had<br>\r\n  been sheltering behind the deckhouse, as there was a rain storm,<br>\r\n  when he saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew,<br>\r\n  come up the companionway, and go along the deck forward and<br>\r\n  disappear.  He followed cautiously, but when he got to bows found<br>\r\n  no one, and the hatchways were all closed.  He was in a panic of<br>\r\n  superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread.  To<br>\r\n  allay it, I shall today search the entire ship carefully from stem<br>\r\n  to stern.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as<br>\r\n  they evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would<br>\r\n  search from stem to stern.  First mate angry, said it was folly,<br>\r\n  and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men, said<br>\r\n  he would engage to keep them out of trouble with the handspike.  I<br>\r\n  let him take the helm, while the rest began a thorough search, all<br>\r\n  keeping abreast, with lanterns.  We left no corner unsearched.  As<br>\r\n  there were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners<br>\r\n  where a man could hide.  Men much relieved when search over, and<br>\r\n  went back to work cheerfully.  First mate scowled, but said<br>\r\n  nothing.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  22 July.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy<br>\r\n  with sails, no time to be frightened.  Men seem to have<br>\r\n  forgotten their dread.  Mate cheerful again, and all on<br>\r\n  good terms.  Praised men for work in bad weather.  Passed<br>\r\n  Gibraltar and out through Straits.  All well.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  24 July.--There seems some doom over this ship.  Already a hand<br>\r\n  short, and entering the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and<br>\r\n  yet last night another man lost, disappeared.  Like the first, he<br>\r\n  came off his watch and was not seen again.  Men all in a panic of<br>\r\n  fear, sent a round robin, asking to have double watch, as they<br>\r\n  fear to be alone.  Mate angry.  Fear there will be some trouble,<br>\r\n  as either he or the men will do some violence.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  28 July.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of<br>\r\n  maelstrom, and the wind a tempest.  No sleep for any one.<br>\r\n  Men all worn out.  Hardly know how to set a watch, since no<br>\r\n  one fit to go on.  Second mate volunteered to steer and<br>\r\n  watch, and let men snatch a few hours sleep.  Wind abating,<br>\r\n  seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is<br>\r\n  steadier.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  29 July.--Another tragedy.  Had single watch tonight, as crew too<br>\r\n  tired to double.  When morning watch came on deck could find no<br>\r\n  one except steersman.  Raised outcry, and all came on deck.<br>\r\n  Thorough search, but no one found.  Are now without second mate,<br>\r\n  and crew in a panic.  Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and<br>\r\n  wait for any sign of cause.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  30 July.--Last night.  Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather<br>\r\n  fine, all sails set.  Retired worn out, slept soundly, awakened by<br>\r\n  mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing.<br>\r\n  Only self and mate and two hands left to work ship.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  1 August.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted.  Had hoped<br>\r\n  when in the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get<br>\r\n  in somewhere.  Not having power to work sails, have to run before<br>\r\n  wind.  Dare not lower, as could not raise them again.  We seem to<br>\r\n  be drifting to some terrible doom.  Mate now more demoralised than<br>\r\n  either of men.  His stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly<br>\r\n  against himself.  Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and<br>\r\n  patiently, with minds made up to worst.  They are Russian, he<br>\r\n  Roumanian.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  2 August, midnight.--Woke up from few minutes sleep by hearing a<br>\r\n  cry, seemingly outside my port.  Could see nothing in fog.  Rushed<br>\r\n  on deck, and ran against mate. Tells me he heard cry and ran, but<br>\r\n  no sign of man on watch.  One more gone.  Lord, help us!  Mate<br>\r\n  says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog<br>\r\n  lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out.<br>\r\n  If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us<br>\r\n  in the fog, which seems to move with us, and God seems to have<br>\r\n  deserted us.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  3 August.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the<br>\r\n  wheel and when I got to it found no one there.  The wind<br>\r\n  was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing.  I<br>\r\n  dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate.  After a few<br>\r\n  seconds, he rushed up on deck in his flannels.  He looked<br>\r\n  wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has<br>\r\n  given way.  He came close to me and whispered hoarsely,<br>\r\n  with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air<br>\r\n  might hear.  "It is here.  I know it now.  On the watch<br>\r\n  last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly<br>\r\n  pale.  It was in the bows, and looking out.  I crept behind<br>\r\n  It, and gave it my knife, but the knife went through It,<br>\r\n  empty as the air."  And as he spoke he took the knife and<br>\r\n  drove it savagely into space.  Then he went on, "But It is<br>\r\n  here, and I''ll find It.  It is in the hold, perhaps in one<br>\r\n  of those boxes.  I''ll unscrew them one by one and see.  You<br>\r\n  work the helm."  And with a warning look and his finger on<br>\r\n  his lip, he went below.  There was springing up a choppy<br>\r\n  wind, and I could not leave the helm.  I saw him come out<br>\r\n  on deck again with a tool chest and lantern, and go down<br>\r\n  the forward hatchway.  He is mad, stark, raving mad, and<br>\r\n  it''s no use my trying to stop him.  He can''t hurt those big<br>\r\n  boxes, they are invoiced as clay, and to pull them about is<br>\r\n  as harmless a thing as he can do.  So here I stay and mind<br>\r\n  the helm, and write these notes.  I can only trust in God<br>\r\n  and wait till the fog clears.  Then, if I can''t steer to<br>\r\n  any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails,<br>\r\n  and lie by, and signal for help&#8230;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  It is nearly all over now.  Just as I was beginning to hope<br>\r\n  that the mate would come out calmer, for I heard him<br>\r\n  knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good<br>\r\n  for him, there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled<br>\r\n  scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he<br>\r\n  came as if shot from a gun, a raging madman, with his eyes<br>\r\n  rolling and his face convulsed with fear.  "Save me!  Save<br>\r\n  me!" he cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog.<br>\r\n  His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he<br>\r\n  said, "You had better come too, captain, before it is too<br>\r\n  late.  He is there!  I know the secret now.  The sea will<br>\r\n  save me from Him, and it is all that is left!"  Before I<br>\r\n  could say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang<br>\r\n  on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea.<br>\r\n  I suppose I know the secret too, now.  It was this madman<br>\r\n  who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has<br>\r\n  followed them himself.  God help me!  How am I to account<br>\r\n  for all these horrors when I get to port?  When I get to<br>\r\n  port!  Will that ever be?<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  4 August.--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce, I<br>\r\n  know there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I<br>\r\n  know not.  I dared not go below, I dared not leave the<br>\r\n  helm, so here all night I stayed, and in the dimness of the<br>\r\n  night I saw it, Him!  God, forgive me, but the mate was<br>\r\n  right to jump overboard.  It was better to die like a man.<br>\r\n  To die like a sailor in blue water, no man can object.  But<br>\r\n  I am captain, and I must not leave my ship.  But I shall<br>\r\n  baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to<br>\r\n  the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with<br>\r\n  them I shall tie that which He, It, dare not touch.  And<br>\r\n  then, come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my<br>\r\n  honour as a captain.  I am growing weaker, and the night is<br>\r\n  coming on.  If He can look me in the face again, I may not<br>\r\n  have time to act. . .  If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle<br>\r\n  may be found, and those who find it may understand.  If<br>\r\n  not&#8230; well, then all men shall know that I have been<br>\r\n  true to my trust.  God and the Blessed Virgin and the<br>\r\n  Saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty&#8230;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf course the verdict was an open one.  There is no evidence\r\nto adduce, and whether or not the man himself committed the\r\nmurders there is now none to say.  The folk here hold almost\r\nuniversally that the captain is simply a hero, and he is to be\r\ngiven a public funeral.  Already it is arranged that his body\r\nis to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk for a piece\r\nand then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps,\r\nfor he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff.  The\r\nowners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their\r\nnames as wishing to follow him to the grave.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNo trace has ever been found of the great dog, at which there is\r\nmuch mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he\r\nwould, I believe, be adopted by the town.  Tomorrow will see the\r\nfuneral, and so will end this one more ''mystery of the sea''.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA MURRAY''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n8 August.--Lucy was very restless all night, and I too, could not\r\nsleep.  The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the\r\nchimney pots, it made me shudder.  When a sharp puff came it seemed to\r\nbe like a distant gun.  Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake, but she\r\ngot up twice and dressed herself.  Fortunately, each time I awoke in\r\ntime and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to\r\nbed.  It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as\r\nher will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be\r\nany, disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine\r\nof her life.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEarly in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see\r\nif anything had happened in the night.  There were very few people\r\nabout, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the\r\nbig, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam\r\nthat topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the mouth\r\nof the harbour, like a bullying man going through a crowd.  Somehow I\r\nfelt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land.\r\nBut, oh, is he on land or sea?  Where is he, and how?  I am getting\r\nfearfully anxious about him.  If I only knew what to do, and could do\r\nanything!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n10 August.--The funeral of the poor sea captain today was most\r\ntouching.  Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin\r\nwas carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the\r\nchurchyard.  Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat,\r\nwhilst the cortege of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came\r\ndown again.  We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all\r\nthe way.  The poor fellow was laid to rest near our seat so that we\r\nstood on it, when the time came and saw everything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPoor Lucy seemed much upset.  She was restless and uneasy all the time,\r\nand I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her.\r\nShe is quite odd in one thing.  She will not admit to me that there is\r\nany cause for restlessness, or if there be, she does not understand it\r\nherself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere is an additional cause in that poor Mr. Swales was found dead\r\nthis morning on our seat, his neck being broken.  He had evidently, as\r\nthe doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for\r\nthere was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made\r\nthem shudder.  Poor dear old man!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely\r\nthan other people do.  Just now she was quite upset by a little thing\r\nwhich I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was\r\nfollowed by his dog.  The dog is always with him.  They are both quiet\r\npersons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark.  During\r\nthe service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat\r\nwith us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling.  Its master\r\nspoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily.  But it would\r\nneither come nor cease to make a noise.  It was in a fury, with its\r\neyes savage, and all its hair bristling out like a cat''s tail when puss\r\nis on the war path.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally the man too got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and\r\nthen took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw\r\nit on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed.  The moment it touched\r\nthe stone the poor thing began to tremble.  It did not try to get away,\r\nbut crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable\r\nstate of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog,\r\nbut looked at it in an agonised sort of way.  I greatly fear that she\r\nis of too super sensitive a nature to go through the world without\r\ntrouble.  She will be dreaming of this tonight, I am sure.  The whole\r\nagglomeration of things, the ship steered into port by a dead man, his\r\nattitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads, the touching\r\nfuneral, the dog, now furious and now in terror, will all afford\r\nmaterial for her dreams.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I\r\nshall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood''s Bay and\r\nback.

If it were not that I\r\nhad made my diary a duty I should not open it tonight.  We had a lovely\r\nwalk.  Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some\r\ndear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the\r\nlighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us.  I believe we forgot\r\neverything, except of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the\r\nslate clean and give us a fresh start.  We had a capital ''severe tea''\r\nat Robin Hood''s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow\r\nwindow right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand.  I believe\r\nwe should have shocked the ''New Woman'' with our appetites.  Men are\r\nmore tolerant, bless them!  Then we walked home with some, or rather\r\nmany, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread\r\nof wild bulls.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as\r\nwe could.  The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked\r\nhim to stay for supper.  Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the\r\ndusty miller.  I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite\r\nheroic.  I think that some day the bishops must get together and see\r\nabout breeding up a new class of curates, who don''t take supper, no\r\nmatter how hard they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls\r\nare tired.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy is asleep and breathing softly.  She has more colour in her cheeks\r\nthan usual, and looks, oh so sweet.  If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with\r\nher seeing her only in the drawing room, I wonder what he would say if\r\nhe saw her now.  Some of the ''New Women'' writers will some day start an\r\nidea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep\r\nbefore proposing or accepting.  But I suppose the ''New Woman'' won''t\r\ncondescend in future to accept.  She will do the proposing herself.  And\r\na nice job she will make of it too!  There''s some consolation in that.\r\nI am so happy tonight, because dear Lucy seems better.  I really\r\nbelieve she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles\r\nwith dreaming.  I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan&#8230;\r\nGod bless and keep him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n11 August.--Diary again.  No sleep now, so I may as well write.  I am\r\ntoo agitated to sleep.  We have had such an adventure, such an\r\nagonizing experience.  I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary.\r\n. . .  Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense\r\nof fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me.  The room\r\nwas dark, so I could not see Lucy''s bed.  I stole across and felt for\r\nher.  The bed was empty.  I lit a match and found that she was not in\r\nthe room.  The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it.  I feared\r\nto wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw\r\non some clothes and got ready to look for her.  As I was leaving the\r\nroom it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to\r\nher dreaming intention.  Dressing-gown would mean house, dress outside.\r\nDressing-gown and dress were both in their places.  "Thank God," I said\r\nto myself, "she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room.  Not there!  Then I\r\nlooked in all the other rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear\r\nchilling my heart.  Finally, I came to the hall door and found it open.\r\nIt was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught.  The\r\npeople of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I\r\nfeared that Lucy must have gone out as she was.  There was no time to\r\nthink of what might happen.  A vague over-mastering fear obscured all\r\ndetails.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI took a big, heavy shawl and ran out.  The clock was striking one as I\r\nwas in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight.  I ran along\r\nthe North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I\r\nexpected.  At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across\r\nthe harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear, I don''t know which,\r\nof seeing Lucy in our favourite seat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which\r\nthrew the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as\r\nthey sailed across.  For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the\r\nshadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary''s Church and all around it.  Then\r\nas the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into\r\nview, and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut\r\nmoved along, the church and churchyard became gradually visible.\r\nWhatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our\r\nfavourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining\r\nfigure, snowy white.  The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to\r\nsee much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately, but it\r\nseemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the\r\nwhite figure shone, and bent over it.  What it was, whether man or\r\nbeast, I could not tell.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps\r\nto the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the\r\nonly way to reach the East Cliff.  The town seemed as dead, for not a\r\nsoul did I see.  I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of\r\npoor Lucy''s condition.  The time and distance seemed endless, and my\r\nknees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless\r\nsteps to the abbey.  I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as\r\nif my feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my\r\nbody were rusty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure,\r\nfor I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of\r\nshadow.  There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over\r\nthe half-reclining white figure.  I called in fright, "Lucy!  Lucy!"\r\nand something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white\r\nface and red, gleaming eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard.\r\nAs I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute\r\nor so I lost sight of her.  When I came in view again the cloud had\r\npassed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy\r\nhalf reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat.  She was\r\nquite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep.  Her lips\r\nwere parted, and she was breathing, not softly as usual with her, but\r\nin long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every\r\nbreath.  As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled\r\nthe collar of her nightdress close around her, as though she felt the\r\ncold.  I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight around\r\nher neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the\r\nnight air, unclad as she was.  I feared to wake her all at once, so, in\r\norder to have my hands free to help her, I fastened the shawl at her\r\nthroat with a big safety pin.  But I must have been clumsy in my\r\nanxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her\r\nbreathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and\r\nmoaned.  When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her\r\nfeet, and then began very gently to wake her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt first she did not respond, but gradually she became more and more\r\nuneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally.  At last, as\r\ntime was passing fast, and for many other reasons, I wished to get her\r\nhome at once, I shook her forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes\r\nand awoke.  She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she\r\ndid not realize all at once where she was.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must\r\nhave been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking\r\nunclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace.  She\r\ntrembled a little, and clung to me.  When I told her to come at once\r\nwith me home, she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child.\r\nAs we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince.\r\nShe stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes, but I would\r\nnot.  However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where\r\nthere was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet\r\nwith mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went\r\nhome, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare\r\nfeet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul.  Once we\r\nsaw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front\r\nof us.  But we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such\r\nas there are here, steep little closes, or ''wynds'', as they call them\r\nin Scotland.  My heart beat so loud all the time sometimes I thought I\r\nshould faint.  I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her\r\nhealth, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her\r\nreputation in case the story should get wind.  When we got in, and had\r\nwashed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I\r\ntucked her into bed.  Before falling asleep she asked, even implored,\r\nme not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her\r\nsleep-walking adventure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI hesitated at first, to promise, but on thinking of the state of her\r\nmother''s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,\r\nand think too, of how such a story might become distorted, nay,\r\ninfallibly would, in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do\r\nso.  I hope I did right.  I have locked the door, and the key is tied\r\nto my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed.  Lucy is\r\nsleeping soundly.  The reflex of the dawn is high and far over the\r\nsea&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSame day, noon.--All goes well.  Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed\r\nnot to have even changed her side.  The adventure of the night does not\r\nseem to have harmed her, on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she\r\nlooks better this morning than she has done for weeks.  I was sorry to\r\nnotice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her.  Indeed, it\r\nmight have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced.  I\r\nmust have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for\r\nthere are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her\r\nnightdress was a drop of blood.  When I apologised and was concerned\r\nabout it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it.\r\nFortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSame day, night.--We passed a happy day.  The air was clear, and the\r\nsun bright, and there was a cool breeze.  We took our lunch to Mulgrave\r\nWoods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the\r\ncliff-path and joining her at the gate.  I felt a little sad myself,\r\nfor I could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had\r\nJonathan been with me.  But there!  I must only be patient.  In the\r\nevening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by\r\nSpohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early.  Lucy seems more restful\r\nthan she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once.  I shall lock\r\nthe door and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect\r\nany trouble tonight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n12 August.--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I\r\nwas wakened by Lucy trying to get out.  She seemed, even in her sleep,\r\nto be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed\r\nunder a sort of protest.  I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds\r\nchirping outside of the window.  Lucy woke, too, and I was glad to see,\r\nwas even better than on the previous morning.  All her old gaiety of\r\nmanner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me\r\nand told me all about Arthur.  I told her how anxious I was about\r\nJonathan, and then she tried to comfort me.  Well, she succeeded\r\nsomewhat, for, though sympathy can''t alter facts, it can make them more\r\nbearable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n13 August.--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as\r\nbefore.  Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,\r\nstill asleep, pointing to the window.  I got up quietly, and pulling\r\naside the blind, looked out.  It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft\r\neffect of the light over the sea and sky, merged together in one great\r\nsilent mystery, was beautiful beyond words.  Between me and the\r\nmoonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling\r\ncircles.  Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose,\r\nfrightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards\r\nthe abbey.  When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again,\r\nand was sleeping peacefully.  She did not stir again all night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n14 August.--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day.  Lucy seems\r\nto have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to\r\nget her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or\r\ndinner.  This afternoon she made a funny remark.  We were coming home\r\nfor dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier\r\nand stopped to look at the view, as we generally do.  The setting sun,\r\nlow down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness.  The red\r\nlight was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed\r\nto bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow.  We were silent for a\r\nwhile, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"His red eyes again!  They are just the same."  It was such an odd\r\nexpression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me.  I\r\nslewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare\r\nat her, and saw that she was in a half dreamy state, with an odd look\r\non her face that I could not quite make out, so I said nothing, but\r\nfollowed her eyes.  She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,\r\nwhereon was a dark figure seated alone.  I was quite a little startled\r\nmyself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes\r\nlike burning flames, but a second look dispelled the illusion.  The red\r\nsunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary''s Church behind our\r\nseat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the\r\nrefraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved.  I\r\ncalled Lucy''s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself\r\nwith a start, but she looked sad all the same.  It may have been that\r\nshe was thinking of that terrible night up there.  We never refer to\r\nit, so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner.  Lucy had a headache\r\nand went early to bed.  I saw her asleep, and went out for a little\r\nstroll myself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet\r\nsadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan.  When coming home, it was then\r\nbright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the\r\nCrescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen, I threw a glance\r\nup at our window, and saw Lucy''s head leaning out.  I opened my\r\nhandkerchief and waved it.  She did not notice or make any movement\r\nwhatever.  Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the\r\nbuilding, and the light fell on the window.  There distinctly was Lucy\r\nwith her head lying up against the side of the window sill and her eyes\r\nshut.  She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window sill, was\r\nsomething that looked like a good-sized bird.  I was afraid she might\r\nget a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was\r\nmoving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily.  She was\r\nholding her hand to her throat, as though to protect if from the cold.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly.  I have taken care that\r\nthe door is locked and the window securely fastened.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe looks so sweet as she sleeps, but she is paler than is her wont,\r\nand there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like.\r\nI fear she is fretting about something.  I wish I could find out what it\r\nis.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n15 August.--Rose later than usual.  Lucy was languid and tired, and\r\nslept on after we had been called.  We had a happy surprise at\r\nbreakfast.  Arthur''s father is better, and wants the marriage to come\r\noff soon.  Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry\r\nat once.  Later on in the day she told me the cause.  She is grieved to\r\nlose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have\r\nsome one to protect her.  Poor dear, sweet lady!  She confided to me\r\nthat she has got her death warrant.  She has not told Lucy, and made me\r\npromise secrecy.  Her doctor told her that within a few months, at\r\nmost, she must die, for her heart is weakening.  At any time, even now,\r\na sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her.  Ah, we were wise to\r\nkeep from her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucy''s sleep-walking.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n17 August.--No diary for two whole days.  I have not had the heart to\r\nwrite.  Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our\r\nhappiness.  No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker,\r\nwhilst her mother''s hours are numbering to a close.  I do not\r\nunderstand Lucy''s fading away as she is doing.  She eats well and\r\nsleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air, but all the time the roses in\r\nher cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day by day.\r\nAt night I hear her gasping as if for air.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night, but\r\nshe gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window.\r\nLast night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to\r\nwake her I could not.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe was in a faint.  When I managed to restore her, she was weak as\r\nwater, and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath.\r\nWhen I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head\r\nand turned away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the\r\nsafety-pin.  I looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the\r\ntiny wounds seem not to have healed.  They are still open, and, if\r\nanything, larger than before, and the edges of them are faintly white.\r\nThey are like little white dots with red centres.  Unless they heal\r\nwithin a day or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, SAMUEL F.

Lucy is ever so much better.  Last night she slept well\r\nall night, and did not disturb me once.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still\r\nsadly pale and wan-looking.  If she were in any way anemic I could\r\nunderstand it, but she is not.  She is in gay spirits and full of life\r\nand cheerfulness.  All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from\r\nher, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of\r\nthat night, and that it was here, on this very seat, I found her\r\nasleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the\r\nstone slab and said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My poor little feet didn''t make much noise then!  I daresay poor old\r\nMr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn''t want to wake\r\nup Geordie."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had\r\ndreamed at all that night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead,\r\nwhich Arthur, I call him Arthur from her habit, says he loves, and\r\nindeed, I don''t wonder that he does.  Then she went on in a\r\nhalf-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I didn''t quite dream, but it all seemed to be real.  I only wanted to\r\nbe here in this spot.  I don''t know why, for I was afraid of something,\r\nI don''t know what.  I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing\r\nthrough the streets and over the bridge.  A fish leaped as I went by,\r\nand I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling.  The\r\nwhole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once, as\r\nI went up the steps.  Then I had a vague memory of something long and\r\ndark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very\r\nsweet and very bitter all around me at once.  And then I seemed sinking\r\ninto deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have\r\nheard there is to drowning men, and then everything seemed passing away\r\nfrom me.  My soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the\r\nair.  I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under\r\nme, and then there was a sort of agonizing feeling, as if I were in an\r\nearthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body.  I saw you\r\ndo it before I felt you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen she began to laugh.  It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I\r\nlistened to her breathlessly.  I did not quite like it, and thought it\r\nbetter not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to another\r\nsubject, and Lucy was like her old self again.  When we got home the\r\nfresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more\r\nrosy.  Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very\r\nhappy evening together.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n19 August.--Joy, joy, joy!  Although not all joy.  At last, news of\r\nJonathan.  The dear fellow has been ill, that is why he did not write.\r\nI am not afraid to think it or to say it, now that I know.  Mr. Hawkins\r\nsent me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh so kindly.  I am to leave\r\nin the morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if\r\nnecessary, and to bring him home.  Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a\r\nbad thing if we were to be married out there.  I have cried over the\r\ngood Sister''s letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it\r\nlies.  It is of Jonathan, and must be near my heart, for he is in my\r\nheart.  My journey is all mapped out, and my luggage ready.  I am only\r\ntaking one change of dress.  Lucy will bring my trunk to London and\r\nkeep it till I send for it, for it may be that&#8230;  I must write no\r\nmore.  I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband.  The letter that\r\nhe has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, SISTER AGATHA, HOSPITAL OF ST. JOSEPH AND\r\nSTE. MARY BUDA-PESTH, TO MISS WILLHELMINA MURRAY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n12 August,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Dear Madam.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong\r\nenough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St.\r\nJoseph and Ste. Mary.  He has been under our care for nearly six\r\nweeks, suffering from a violent brain fever.  He wishes me to convey\r\nhis love, and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter\r\nHawkins, Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry\r\nfor his delay, and that all of his work is completed.  He will\r\nrequire some few weeks'' rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but\r\nwill then return.  He wishes me to say that he has not sufficient\r\nmoney with him, and that he would like to pay for his staying here,\r\nso that others who need shall not be wanting for help.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Believe me,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yours, with sympathy\r\nand all blessings.\r\nSister Agatha\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"P.S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know\r\nsomething more.  He has told me all about you, and that you are\r\nshortly to be his wife.  All blessings to you both!  He has had some\r\nfearful shock, so says our doctor, and in his delirium his ravings\r\nhave been dreadful, of wolves and poison and blood, of ghosts and\r\ndemons, and I fear to say of what.  Be careful of him always that\r\nthere may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to\r\ncome.  The traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away.\r\nWe should have written long ago, but we knew nothing of his friends,\r\nand there was nothing on him, nothing that anyone could understand.\r\nHe came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard was told by the\r\nstation master there that he rushed into the station shouting for a\r\nticket for home.  Seeing from his violent demeanour that he was\r\nEnglish, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way\r\nthither that the train reached.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Be assured that he is well cared for.  He has won all hearts by his\r\nsweetness and gentleness.  He is truly getting on well, and I have\r\nno doubt will in a few weeks be all himself.  But be careful of him\r\nfor safety''s sake.  There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste.\r\nMary, many, many, happy years for you both."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n19 August.--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night.  About\r\neight o''clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does\r\nwhen setting.  The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my\r\ninterest in him, encouraged him to talk.  He is usually respectful to\r\nthe attendant and at times servile, but tonight, the man tells me, he\r\nwas quite haughty.  Would not condescend to talk with him at all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll he would say was, "I don''t want to talk to you.  You don''t count\r\nnow.  The master is at hand."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which\r\nhas seized him.  If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man\r\nwith homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous.  The\r\ncombination is a dreadful one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt nine o''clock I visited him myself.  His attitude to me was the same\r\nas that to the attendant.  In his sublime self-feeling the difference\r\nbetween myself and the attendant seemed to him as nothing.  It looks\r\nlike religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThese infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for\r\nan Omnipotent Being.  How these madmen give themselves away!  The real\r\nGod taketh heed lest a sparrow fall.  But the God created from human\r\nvanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow.  Oh, if men\r\nonly knew!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and\r\ngreater degree.  I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept\r\nstrict observation all the same.  All at once that shifty look came\r\ninto his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and\r\nwith it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum\r\nattendants come to know so well.  He became quite quiet, and went and\r\nsat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space with\r\nlack-luster eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and\r\ntried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed\r\nto excite his attention.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt first he made no reply, but at length said testily, "Bother them\r\nall!  I don''t care a pin about them."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What?" I said.  "You don''t mean to tell me you don''t care about\r\nspiders?"  (Spiders at present are his hobby and the notebook is filling\r\nup with columns of small figures.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo this he answered enigmatically, "The Bride maidens rejoice the eyes\r\nthat wait the coming of the bride.  But when the bride draweth nigh,\r\nthen the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his\r\nbed all the time I remained with him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am weary tonight and low in spirits.  I cannot but think of Lucy, and\r\nhow different things might have been.  If I don''t sleep at once,\r\nchloral, the modern Morpheus!  I must be careful not to let it grow\r\ninto a habit.  No, I shall take none tonight!  I have thought of Lucy,\r\nand I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two.  If need be, tonight\r\nshall be sleepless.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Glad I made the resolution, gladder that I kept to it.  I had\r\nlain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the\r\nnight watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield\r\nhad escaped.  I threw on my clothes and ran down at once.  My patient\r\nis too dangerous a person to be roaming about.  Those ideas of his\r\nmight work out dangerously with strangers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe attendant was waiting for me.  He said he had seen him not ten\r\nminutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked through\r\nthe observation trap in the door.  His attention was called by the\r\nsound of the window being wrenched out.  He ran back and saw his feet\r\ndisappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me.  He was\r\nonly in his night gear, and cannot be far off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should\r\ngo than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out\r\nof the building by the door.  He is a bulky man, and couldn''t get\r\nthrough the window.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and as we\r\nwere only a few feet above ground landed unhurt.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a\r\nstraight line, so I ran as quickly as I could.  As I got through the\r\nbelt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates\r\nour grounds from those of the deserted house.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men\r\nimmediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our\r\nfriend might be dangerous.  I got a ladder myself, and crossing the\r\nwall, dropped down on the other side.  I could see Renfield''s figure\r\njust disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him.  On\r\nthe far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old\r\niron-bound oak door of the chapel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near\r\nenough to hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he\r\nshould run off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nChasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked\r\nlunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him!  After a few minutes,\r\nhowever, I could see that he did not take note of anything around him,\r\nand so ventured to draw nearer to him, the more so as my men had now\r\ncrossed the wall and were closing him in.  I heard him say&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I am here to do your bidding, Master.  I am your slave, and you will\r\nreward me, for I shall be faithful.  I have worshipped you long and afar\r\noff.  Now that you are near, I await your commands, and you will not\r\npass me by, will you, dear Master, in your distribution of good\r\nthings?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe is a selfish old beggar anyhow.  He thinks of the loaves and fishes\r\neven when he believes he is in a real Presence.  His manias make a\r\nstartling combination.  When we closed in on him he fought like a\r\ntiger.  He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than\r\na man.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before, and I hope I\r\nshall not again.  It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and\r\nhis danger in good time.  With strength and determination like his, he\r\nmight have done wild work before he was caged.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe is safe now, at any rate.  Jack Sheppard himself couldn''t get free\r\nfrom the strait waistcoat that keeps him restrained, and he''s chained\r\nto the wall in the padded room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more\r\ndeadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust now he spoke coherent words for the first time.  "I shall be\r\npatient, Master.  It is coming, coming, coming!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo I took the hint, and came too.  I was too excited to sleep, but this\r\ndiary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep tonight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n');

I feel that I can hardly\r\nrecall anything of the journey, except that I knew I was coming to\r\nJonathan, and that as I should have to do some nursing, I had better\r\nget all the sleep I could.  I found my dear one, oh, so thin and\r\npale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out of his dear\r\neyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has\r\nvanished.  He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember\r\nanything that has happened to him for a long time past.  At least,\r\nhe wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He has had some terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor\r\nbrain if he were to try to recall it.  Sister Agatha, who is a good\r\ncreature and a born nurse, tells me that he wanted her to tell me\r\nwhat they were, but she would only cross herself, and say she would\r\nnever tell.  That the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God,\r\nand that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them, she\r\nshould respect her trust.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she saw I was\r\ntroubled, she opened up the subject my poor dear raved about, added,\r\n''I can tell you this much, my dear.  That it was not about anything\r\nwhich he has done wrong himself, and you, as his wife to be, have no\r\ncause to be concerned.  He has not forgotten you or what he owes to\r\nyou.  His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can\r\ntreat of.''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor\r\ndear should have fallen in love with any other girl.  The idea of my\r\nbeing jealous about Jonathan!  And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I\r\nfelt a thrill of joy through me when I knew that no other woman was\r\na cause for trouble.  I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can\r\nsee his face while he sleeps.  He is waking!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get\r\nsomething from the pocket.  I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought\r\nall his things.  I saw amongst them was his notebook, and was\r\ngoing to ask him to let me look at it, for I knew that I might find\r\nsome clue to his trouble, but I suppose he must have seen my wish in\r\nmy eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying he wanted to be\r\nquite alone for a moment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then he called me back, and he said to me very solemnly,\r\n''Wilhelmina'', I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has\r\nnever called me by that name since he asked me to marry him, ''You\r\nknow, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife.  There\r\nshould be no secret, no concealment.  I have had a great shock, and\r\nwhen I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I\r\ndo not know if it was real of the dreaming of a madman.  You know I\r\nhad brain fever, and that is to be mad.  The secret is here, and I\r\ndo not want to know it.  I want to take up my life here, with our\r\nmarriage.''  For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as\r\nthe formalities are complete.  ''Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to\r\nshare my ignorance?  Here is the book.  Take it and keep it, read it\r\nif you will, but never let me know unless, indeed, some solemn duty\r\nshould come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake,\r\nsane or mad, recorded here.''  He fell back exhausted, and I put the\r\nbook under his pillow, and kissed him.  I have asked Sister Agatha\r\nto beg the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am\r\nwaiting her reply&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"She has come and told me that the Chaplain of the English mission\r\nchurch has been sent for.  We are to be married in an hour, or as\r\nsoon after as Jonathan awakes."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Lucy, the time has come and gone.  I feel very solemn, but very,\r\nvery happy.  Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was\r\nready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows.  He answered\r\nhis ''I will'' firmly and strong.  I could hardly speak.  My heart was\r\nso full that even those words seemed to choke me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The dear sisters were so kind.  Please, God, I shall never, never\r\nforget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken\r\nupon me.  I must tell you of my wedding present.  When the chaplain\r\nand the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it is\r\nthe first time I have written the words ''my husband''--left me alone\r\nwith my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped\r\nit up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue\r\nribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with\r\nsealing wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring.  Then I kissed\r\nit and showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep it\r\nso, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our\r\nlives that we trusted each other, that I would never open it unless\r\nit were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty.\r\nThen he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he\r\ntook his wife''s hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in all\r\nthe wide world, and that he would go through all the past again to\r\nwin it, if need be.  The poor dear meant to have said a part of the\r\npast, but he cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at\r\nfirst he mixes up not only the month, but the year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, my dear, what could I say?  I could only tell him that I was\r\nthe happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to\r\ngive him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these\r\nwent my love and duty for all the days of my life.  And, my dear,\r\nwhen he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it\r\nwas like a solemn pledge between us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?  It is not only\r\nbecause it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are,\r\nvery dear to me.  It was my privilege to be your friend and guide\r\nwhen you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life.\r\nI want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife,\r\nwhither duty has led me, so that in your own married life you too\r\nmay be all happy, as I am.  My dear, please Almighty God, your life\r\nmay be all it promises, a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind,\r\nno forgetting duty, no distrust.  I must not wish you no pain, for\r\nthat can never be, but I do hope you will be always as happy as I am\r\nnow.  Goodbye, my dear.  I shall post this at once, and perhaps,\r\nwrite you very soon again.  I must stop, for Jonathan is waking.  I\r\nmust attend my husband!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Your ever-loving\r\nMina Harker."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA HARKER.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhitby, 30 August.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My dearest Mina,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your\r\nown home with your husband.  I wish you were coming home soon enough\r\nto stay with us here.  The strong air would soon restore Jonathan.\r\nIt has quite restored me.  I have an appetite like a cormorant, am\r\nfull of life, and sleep well.  You will be glad to know that I have\r\nquite given up walking in my sleep.  I think I have not stirred out\r\nof my bed for a week, that is when I once got into it at night.\r\nArthur says I am getting fat.  By the way, I forgot to tell you that\r\nArthur is here.  We have such walks and drives, and rides, and\r\nrowing, and tennis, and fishing together, and I love him more than\r\never.  He tells me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at\r\nfirst he told me that he couldn''t love me more than he did then.\r\nBut this is nonsense.  There he is, calling to me.  So no more just\r\nat present from your loving,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Lucy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"P.S.--Mother sends her love.

SEWARDS DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n20 August.--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting.  He has\r\nnow so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his\r\npassion.  For the first week after his attack he was perpetually\r\nviolent.  Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and\r\nkept murmuring to himself.  "Now I can wait.  Now I can wait."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at\r\nhim.  He was still in the strait waistcoat and in the padded room, but\r\nthe suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something\r\nof their old pleading.  I might almost say, cringing, softness.  I was\r\nsatisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved.\r\nThe attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without\r\nprotest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their\r\ndistrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while\r\nlooking furtively at them, "They think I could hurt you!  Fancy me\r\nhurting you!  The fools!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself disassociated\r\neven in the mind of this poor madman from the others, but all the same\r\nI do not follow his thought.  Am I to take it that I have anything in\r\ncommon with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together.  Or\r\nhas he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well being is\r\nneedful to Him?  I must find out later on.  Tonight he will not speak.\r\nEven the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt\r\nhim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe will only say, "I don''t take any stock in cats.  I have more to\r\nthink of now, and I can wait.  I can wait."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a while I left him.  The attendant tells me that he was quiet\r\nuntil just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at\r\nlength violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted\r\nhim so that he swooned into a sort of coma.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n. . . Three nights has the same thing happened, violent all day then\r\nquiet from moonrise to sunrise.  I wish I could get some clue to the\r\ncause.  It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came\r\nand went.  Happy thought!  We shall tonight play sane wits against mad\r\nones.  He escaped before without our help.  Tonight he shall escape\r\nwith it.  We shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow\r\nin case they are required.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n23 August.--"The expected always happens."  How well Disraeli knew\r\nlife.  Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our\r\nsubtle arrangements were for nought.  At any rate, we have proved one\r\nthing, that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time.  We shall\r\nin future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day.  I have\r\ngiven orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded\r\nroom, when once he is quiet, until the hour before sunrise.  The poor\r\nsoul''s body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate\r\nit.  Hark!  The unexpected again!  I am called.  The patient has once\r\nmore escaped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Another night adventure.  Renfield artfully waited until the\r\nattendant was entering the room to inspect.  Then he dashed out past\r\nhim and flew down the passage.  I sent word for the attendants to\r\nfollow.  Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we\r\nfound him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door.\r\nWhen he saw me he became furious, and had not the attendants seized\r\nhim in time, he would have tried to kill me.  As we were holding him a\r\nstrange thing happened.  He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then\r\nas suddenly grew calm.  I looked round instinctively, but could see\r\nnothing.  Then I caught the patient''s eye and followed it, but could\r\ntrace nothing as it looked into the moonlight sky, except a big bat,\r\nwhich was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west.  Bats\r\nusually wheel about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it\r\nknew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said, "You\r\nneedn''t tie me.  I shall go quietly!"  Without trouble, we came back\r\nto the house.  I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and\r\nshall not forget this night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLUCY WESTENRA''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHillingham, 24 August.--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things\r\ndown.  Then we can have long talks when we do meet.  I wonder when it\r\nwill be.  I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy.  Last\r\nnight I seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby.  Perhaps\r\nit is the change of air, or getting home again.  It is all dark and\r\nhorrid to me, for I can remember nothing.  But I am full of vague\r\nfear, and I feel so weak and worn out.  When Arthur came to lunch he\r\nlooked quite grieved when he saw me, and I hadn''t the spirit to try to\r\nbe cheerful.  I wonder if I could sleep in mother''s room tonight.  I\r\nshall make an excuse to try.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n25 August.--Another bad night.  Mother did not seem to take to my\r\nproposal.  She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to\r\nworry me.  I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while, but when\r\nthe clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been\r\nfalling asleep.  There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the\r\nwindow, but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I\r\nmust have fallen asleep.  More bad dreams.  I wish I could remember\r\nthem.  This morning I am horribly weak.  My face is ghastly pale, and\r\nmy throat pains me.  It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I\r\ndon''t seem to be getting air enough.  I shall try to cheer up when\r\nArthur comes, or else I know he will be miserable to see me so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, ARTHUR TO DR.

Lucy is ill, that is she has no\r\nspecial disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every\r\nday.  I have asked her if there is any cause, I not dare to ask her\r\nmother, for to disturb the poor lady''s mind about her daughter in\r\nher present state of health would be fatal.  Mrs. Westenra has\r\nconfided to me that her doom is spoken, disease of the heart, though\r\npoor Lucy does not know it yet.  I am sure that there is something\r\npreying on my dear girl''s mind.  I am almost distracted when I think\r\nof her.  To look at her gives me a pang.  I told her I should ask\r\nyou to see her, and though she demurred at first, I know why, old\r\nfellow, she finally consented.  It will be a painful task for you, I\r\nknow, old friend, but it is for her sake, and I must not hesitate to\r\nask, or you to act.  You are to come to lunch at Hillingham\r\ntomorrow, two o''clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in Mrs.\r\nWestenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being\r\nalone with you.  I am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with\r\nyou alone as soon as I can after you have seen her.  Do not fail!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Arthur."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTELEGRAM, ARTHUR HOLMWOOD TO SEWARD\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 September\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Am summoned to see my father, who is worse.

SEWARD TO ARTHUR HOLMWOOD\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 September\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My dear old fellow,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"With regard to Miss Westenra''s health I hasten to let you know at\r\nonce that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or\r\nany malady that I know of.  At the same time, I am not by any means\r\nsatisfied with her appearance. She is woefully different from what\r\nshe was when I saw her last.  Of course you must bear in mind that I\r\ndid not have full opportunity of examination such as I should wish.\r\nOur very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical\r\nscience or custom can bridge over.  I had better tell you exactly\r\nwhat happened, leaving you to draw, in a measure, your own\r\nconclusions.  I shall then say what I have done and propose doing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits.  Her mother was\r\npresent, and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying\r\nall she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being\r\nanxious.  I have no doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what\r\nneed of caution there is.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful,\r\nwe got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real\r\ncheerfulness amongst us.  Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and\r\nLucy was left with me.  We went into her boudoir, and till we got\r\nthere her gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her\r\nface, and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her\r\neyes with her hand.  When I saw that her high spirits had failed, I\r\nat once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"She said to me very sweetly, ''I cannot tell you how I loathe\r\ntalking about myself.''  I reminded her that a doctor''s confidence\r\nwas sacred, but that you were grievously anxious about her.  She\r\ncaught on to my meaning at once, and settled that matter in a word.\r\n''Tell Arthur everything you choose.  I do not care for myself, but\r\nfor him!''  So I am quite free.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I could easily see that she was somewhat bloodless, but I could not\r\nsee the usual anemic signs, and by the chance, I was able to test\r\nthe actual quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was\r\nstiff a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken\r\nglass.  It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident\r\nchance, and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed\r\nthem.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The qualitative analysis give a quite normal condition, and shows,\r\nI should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health.  In other\r\nphysical matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for\r\nanxiety, but as there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the\r\nconclusion that it must be something mental.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"She complains of difficulty breathing satisfactorily at times, and\r\nof heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but\r\nregarding which she can remember nothing.  She says that as a child,\r\nshe used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit\r\ncame back, and that once she walked out in the night and went to\r\nEast Cliff, where Miss Murray found her.  But she assures me that of\r\nlate the habit has not returned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of. I have\r\nwritten to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of\r\nAmsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in\r\nthe world.  I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that\r\nall things were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who\r\nyou are and your relations to Miss Westenra.  This, my dear fellow,\r\nis in obedience to your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to\r\ndo anything I can for her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal\r\nreason, so no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his\r\nwishes.  He is a seemingly arbitrary man, this is because he knows\r\nwhat he is talking about better than any one else.  He is a\r\nphilosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced\r\nscientists of his day, and he has, I believe, an absolutely open\r\nmind.  This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, and\r\nindomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from\r\nvirtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats,\r\nthese form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for\r\nmankind, work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide\r\nas his all-embracing sympathy.  I tell you these facts that you may\r\nknow why I have such confidence in him.  I have asked him to come at\r\nonce.  I shall see Miss Westenra tomorrow again.  She is to meet me\r\nat the Stores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a\r\nrepetition of my call.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yours always."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJohn Seward\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, ABRAHAM VAN HELSING, MD, DPh, D.

By good\r\nfortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who\r\nhave trusted me.  Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who\r\nhave trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those\r\nhe holds dear.  Tell your friend that when that time you suck from\r\nmy wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that\r\nour other friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when\r\nhe wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune\r\ncould do.  But it is pleasure added to do for him, your friend, it\r\nis to you that I come.  Have near at hand, and please it so arrange\r\nthat we may see the young lady not too late on tomorrow, for it is\r\nlikely that I may have to return here that night.  But if need be I\r\nshall come again in three days, and stay longer if it must.  Till\r\nthen goodbye, my friend John.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Van Helsing."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, DR. SEWARD TO HON. ARTHUR HOLMWOOD\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3 September\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My dear Art,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Van Helsing has come and gone.  He came on with me to Hillingham,\r\nand found that, by Lucy''s discretion, her mother was lunching out,\r\nso that we were alone with her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the patient.  He is\r\nto report to me, and I shall advise you, for of course I was not\r\npresent all the time.  He is, I fear, much concerned, but says he\r\nmust think.  When I told him of our friendship and how you trust to\r\nme in the matter, he said, ''You must tell him all you think.  Tell\r\nhim what I think, if you can guess it, if you will.  Nay, I am\r\nnot jesting.  This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.''  I\r\nasked what he meant by that, for he was very serious.  This was when\r\nwe had come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before\r\nstarting on his return to Amsterdam.  He would not give me any\r\nfurther clue.  You must not be angry with me, Art, because his very\r\nreticence means that all his brains are working for her good.  He\r\nwill speak plainly enough when the time comes, be sure.  So I told\r\nhim I would simply write an account of our visit, just as if I were\r\ndoing a descriptive special article for THE DAILY TELEGRAPH.  He\r\nseemed not to notice, but remarked that the smuts of London were not\r\nquite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here.  I am to\r\nget his report tomorrow if he can possibly make it.  In any case I\r\nam to have a letter.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, as to the visit, Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I\r\nfirst saw her, and certainly looked better.  She had lost something\r\nof the ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal.\r\nShe was very sweet to the Professor (as she always is), and tried to\r\nmake him feel at ease, though I could see the poor girl was making a\r\nhard struggle for it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look\r\nunder his bushy brows that I knew of old.  Then he began to\r\nchat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with\r\nsuch an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy''s\r\npretense of animation merge into reality.  Then, without\r\nany seeming change, he brought the conversation gently round\r\nto his visit, and suavely said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are\r\nso much beloved.  That is much, my dear, even were there that which\r\nI do not see.  They told me you were down in the spirit, and that\r\nyou were of a ghastly pale.  To them I say "Pouf!"''  And he snapped\r\nhis fingers at me and went on.  ''But you and I shall show them how\r\nwrong they are.  How can he,'' and he pointed at me with the same\r\nlook and gesture as that with which he pointed me out in his class,\r\non, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never fails to\r\nremind me of, ''know anything of a young ladies?  He has his madmen\r\nto play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and to those that\r\nlove them.  It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards in that\r\nwe can bestow such happiness.  But the young ladies!  He has no wife\r\nnor daughter, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but\r\nto the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes\r\nof them.  So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette\r\nin the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.''\r\nI took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor\r\ncame to the window and called me in.  He looked grave, but said, ''I\r\nhave made careful examination, but there is no functional cause.\r\nWith you I agree that there has been much blood lost, it has been\r\nbut is not.  But the conditions of her are in no way anemic.  I have\r\nasked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two\r\nquestions, that so I may not chance to miss nothing.  I know well\r\nwhat she will say.  And yet there is cause.  There is always cause\r\nfor everything.  I must go back home and think.  You must send me\r\nthe telegram every day, and if there be cause I shall come again.\r\nThe disease, for not to be well is a disease, interest me, and the\r\nsweet, young dear, she interest me too.  She charm me, and for her,\r\nif not for you or disease, I come.''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were\r\nalone.  And so now, Art, you know all I know.  I shall keep stern\r\nwatch.  I trust your poor father is rallying.  It must be a terrible\r\nthing to you, my dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position\r\nbetween two people who are both so dear to you.  I know your idea of\r\nduty to your father, and you are right to stick to it.  But if need\r\nbe, I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy, so do not be\r\nover-anxious unless you hear from me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n4 September.--Zoophagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.\r\nHe had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time.\r\nJust before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless.  The\r\nattendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid.  Fortunately\r\nthe men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of\r\nnoon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him.\r\nIn about five minutes, however, he began to get more quiet, and\r\nfinally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained\r\nup to now.  The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the\r\nparoxysm were really appalling.  I found my hands full when I got in,\r\nattending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him.\r\nIndeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed\r\neven me, though I was some distance away.  It is now after the dinner\r\nhour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding,\r\nwith a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather\r\nto indicate than to show something directly.  I cannot quite\r\nunderstand it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Another change in my patient.  At five o''clock I looked in on\r\nhim, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be.\r\nHe was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his\r\ncapture by making nailmarks on the edge of the door between the ridges\r\nof padding.  When he saw me, he came over and apologized for his bad\r\nconduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to\r\nhis own room, and to have his notebook again.  I thought it well to\r\nhumour him, so he is back in his room with the window open.  He has\r\nthe sugar of his tea spread out on the window sill, and is reaping\r\nquite a harvest of flies.  He is not now eating them, but putting them\r\ninto a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his\r\nroom to find a spider.  I tried to get him to talk about the past few\r\ndays, for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me, but\r\nhe would not rise.  For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said\r\nin a sort of far away voice, as though saying it rather to himself\r\nthan to me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"All over!  All over!  He has deserted me.  No hope for me now unless\r\nI do it myself!"  Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he\r\nsaid, "Doctor, won''t you be very good to me and let me have a little\r\nmore sugar?  I think it would be very good for me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And the flies?" I said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes!  The flies like it, too, and I like the flies, therefore I like\r\nit."  And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do\r\nnot argue.  I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a\r\nman as, I suppose, any in the world.  I wish I could fathom his mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMidnight.--Another change in him.  I had been to see Miss Westenra,\r\nwhom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at\r\nour own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him\r\nyelling.  As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it\r\nbetter than in the morning.  It was a shock to me to turn from the\r\nwonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights\r\nand inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds\r\neven as on foul water, and to realize all the grim sternness of my own\r\ncold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own\r\ndesolate heart to endure it all.  I reached him just as the sun was\r\ngoing down, and from his window saw the red disc sink.  As it sank he\r\nbecame less and less frenzied, and just as it dipped he slid from the\r\nhands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor.  It is wonderful,\r\nhowever, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for\r\nwithin a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him.  I\r\nsignalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see\r\nwhat he would do.  He went straight over to the window and brushed out\r\nthe crumbs of sugar.  Then he took his fly box, and emptied it\r\noutside, and threw away the box.  Then he shut the window, and\r\ncrossing over, sat down on his bed.  All this surprised me, so I asked\r\nhim, "Are you going to keep flies any more?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No," said he.  "I am sick of all that rubbish!"  He certainly is a\r\nwonderfully interesting study.  I wish I could get some glimpse of his\r\nmind or of the cause of his sudden passion.  Stop.  There may be a\r\nclue after all, if we can find why today his paroxysms came on at high\r\nnoon and at sunset.  Can it be that there is a malign influence of the\r\nsun at periods which affects certain natures, as at times the moon\r\ndoes others?  We shall see.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTELEGRAM.

There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it.\r\nMrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has\r\nconsulted me professionally about her.  I took advantage of the\r\nopportunity, and told her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great\r\nspecialist, was coming to stay with me, and that I would put her in\r\nhis charge conjointly with myself.  So now we can come and go\r\nwithout alarming her unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden\r\ndeath, and this, in Lucy''s weak condition, might be disastrous to\r\nher.  We are hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor fellow,\r\nbut, please God, we shall come through them all right.  If any need\r\nI shall write, so that, if you do not hear from me, take it for\r\ngranted that I am simply waiting for news, In haste,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yours ever,"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJohn Seward\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n7 September.--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at\r\nLiverpool Street was, "Have you said anything to our young friend, to\r\nlover of her?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No," I said.  "I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my\r\ntelegram.  I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were\r\ncoming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him\r\nknow if need be."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Right, my friend," he said.  "Quite right!  Better he not know as\r\nyet.  Perhaps he will never know.  I pray so, but if it be needed,\r\nthen he shall know all.  And, my good friend John, let me caution you.\r\nYou deal with the madmen.  All men are mad in some way or the other,\r\nand inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with\r\nGod''s madmen too, the rest of the world.  You tell not your madmen\r\nwhat you do nor why you do it.  You tell them not what you think.  So\r\nyou shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may rest, where it may\r\ngather its kind around it and breed.  You and I shall keep as yet what\r\nwe know here, and here."  He touched me on the heart and on the\r\nforehead, and then touched himself the same way.  "I have for myself\r\nthoughts at the present.  Later I shall unfold to you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Why not now?" I asked.  "It may do some good.  We may arrive at some\r\ndecision."  He looked at me and said, "My friend John, when the corn is\r\ngrown, even before it has ripened, while the milk of its mother earth\r\nis in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his\r\ngold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough\r\nhands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you, ''Look!  He''s\r\ngood corn, he will make a good crop when the time comes.''"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI did not see the application and told him so.  For reply he reached\r\nover and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used\r\nlong ago to do at lectures, and said, "The good husbandman tell you so\r\nthen because he knows, but not till then.  But you do not find the\r\ngood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow.  That is\r\nfor the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it\r\nas of the work of their life.  See you now, friend John?  I have sown\r\nmy corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout, if he\r\nsprout at all, there''s some promise, and I wait till the ear begins to\r\nswell."  He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood.  Then he\r\nwent on gravely, "You were always a careful student, and your case\r\nbook was ever more full than the rest.  And I trust that good habit\r\nhave not fail.  Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than\r\nmemory, and we should not trust the weaker.  Even if you have not kept\r\nthe good practice, let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is\r\none that may be, mind, I say may be, of such interest to us and others\r\nthat all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your people say.\r\nTake then good note of it.  Nothing is too small.  I counsel you, put\r\ndown in record even your doubts and surmises.  Hereafter it may be of\r\ninterest to you to see how true you guess.  We learn from failure, not\r\nfrom success!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I described Lucy''s symptoms, the same as before, but infinitely\r\nmore marked, he looked very grave, but said nothing.  He took with him\r\na bag in which were many instruments and drugs, "the ghastly\r\nparaphernalia of our beneficial trade," as he once called, in one of\r\nhis lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us.  She was alarmed, but not\r\nnearly so much as I expected to find her.  Nature in one of her\r\nbeneficient moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to\r\nits own terrors.  Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal,\r\nmatters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not\r\npersonal, even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so\r\nattached, do not seem to reach her.  It is something like the way dame\r\nNature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive\r\ntissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm\r\nby contact.  If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause\r\nbefore we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be\r\ndeeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and set down\r\na rule that she should not be present with Lucy, or think of her\r\nillness more than was absolutely required.  She assented readily, so\r\nreadily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life.  Van\r\nHelsing and I were shown up to Lucy''s room.  If I was shocked when I\r\nsaw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her today.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe was ghastly, chalkily pale.  The red seemed to have gone even from\r\nher lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently.\r\nHer breathing was painful to see or hear.  Van Helsing''s face grew set\r\nas marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his\r\nnose.  Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to\r\nspeak, so for a while we were all silent.  Then Van Helsing beckoned\r\nto me, and we went gently out of the room.  The instant we had closed\r\nthe door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which\r\nwas open.  Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door.\r\n"My god!" he said.  "This is dreadful.  There is not time to be lost.\r\nShe will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart''s action as it\r\nshould be.  There must be a transfusion of blood at once.  Is it you\r\nor me?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I am younger and stronger, Professor.  It must be me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then get ready at once.  I will bring up my bag.  I am prepared."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at\r\nthe hall door.  When we reached the hall, the maid had just opened the\r\ndoor, and Arthur was stepping quickly in.  He rushed up to me, saying\r\nin an eager whisper,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Jack, I was so anxious.  I read between the lines of your letter, and\r\nhave been in an agony.  The dad was better, so I ran down here to see\r\nfor myself.  Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing?  I am so thankful\r\nto you, sir, for coming."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen first the Professor''s eye had lit upon him, he had been angry at\r\nhis interruption at such a time, but now, as he took in his stalwart\r\nproportions and recognized the strong young manhood which seemed to\r\nemanate from him, his eyes gleamed.  Without a pause he said to him as\r\nhe held out his hand,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Sir, you have come in time.  You are the lover of our dear miss.  She\r\nis bad, very, very bad.  Nay, my child, do not go like that."  For he\r\nsuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting.  "You are\r\nto help her.  You can do more than any that live, and your courage is\r\nyour best help."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely.  "Tell me, and I shall do it.\r\nMy life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for\r\nher."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old\r\nknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that, not the last!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What shall I do?"  There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostrils\r\nquivered with intent.  Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Come!" he said.  "You are a man, and it is a man we want.  You are\r\nbetter than me, better than my friend John."  Arthur looked bewildered,\r\nand the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Young miss is bad, very bad.  She wants blood, and blood she must\r\nhave or die.  My friend John and I have consulted, and we are about to\r\nperform what we call transfusion of blood, to transfer from full veins\r\nof one to the empty veins which pine for him.  John was to give his\r\nblood, as he is the more young and strong than me."--Here Arthur took\r\nmy hand and wrung it hard in silence.--"But now you are here, you are\r\nmore good than us, old or young, who toil much in the world of\r\nthought.  Our nerves are not so calm and our blood so bright than\r\nyours!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur turned to him and said, "If you only knew how gladly I would\r\ndie for her you would understand&#8230;"  He stopped with a sort of\r\nchoke in his voice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good boy!" said Van Helsing.  "In the not-so-far-off you will be\r\nhappy that you have done all for her you love.  Come now and be\r\nsilent.  You shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must\r\ngo, and you must leave at my sign.  Say no word to Madame.  You know\r\nhow it is with her.  There must be no shock, any knowledge of this\r\nwould be one.  Come!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe all went up to Lucy''s room.  Arthur by direction remained outside.\r\nLucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing.  She was not\r\nasleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort.  Her eyes\r\nspoke to us, that was all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little\r\ntable out of sight.  Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the\r\nbed, said cheerily, "Now, little miss, here is your medicine.  Drink\r\nit off, like a good child.  See, I lift you so that to swallow is\r\neasy.  Yes."  She had made the effort with success.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt astonished me how long the drug took to act.  This, in fact, marked\r\nthe extent of her weakness.  The time seemed endless until sleep began\r\nto flicker in her eyelids.  At last, however, the narcotic began to\r\nmanifest its potency, and she fell into a deep sleep.  When the\r\nProfessor was satisfied, he called Arthur into the room, and bade him\r\nstrip off his coat.  Then he added, "You may take that one little kiss\r\nwhiles I bring over the table.  Friend John, help to me!"  So neither\r\nof us looked whilst he bent over her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing, turning to me, said, "He is so young and strong, and of\r\nblood so pure that we need not defibrinate it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed\r\nthe operation.  As the transfusion went on, something like life seemed\r\nto come back to poor Lucy''s cheeks, and through Arthur''s growing\r\npallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine.  After a bit I\r\nbegan to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur,\r\nstrong man as he was.  It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain\r\nLucy''s system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only\r\npartially restored her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut the Professor''s face was set, and he stood watch in hand, and with\r\nhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur.  I could hear my\r\nown heart beat.  Presently, he said in a soft voice, "Do not stir an\r\ninstant.  It is enough.  You attend him.  I will look to her."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen all was over, I could see how much Arthur was weakened.  I\r\ndressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing\r\nspoke without turning round, the man seems to have eyes in the back of\r\nhis head, "The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he\r\nshall have presently."  And as he had now finished his operation, he\r\nadjusted the pillow to the patient''s head.  As he did so the narrow\r\nblack velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat,\r\nbuckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was\r\ndragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn\r\nbreath which is one of Van Helsing''s ways of betraying emotion.  He\r\nsaid nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying, "Now take down\r\nour brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down\r\na while.  He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that\r\nhe may be recruited of what he has so given to his love.  He must not\r\nstay here.  Hold a moment!  I may take it, sir, that you are anxious\r\nof result.  Then bring it with you, that in all ways the operation is\r\nsuccessful.  You have saved her life this time, and you can go home\r\nand rest easy in mind that all that can be is.  I shall tell her all\r\nwhen she is well.  She shall love you none the less for what you have\r\ndone.  Goodbye."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Arthur had gone I went back to the room.  Lucy was sleeping\r\ngently, but her breathing was stronger.  I could see the counterpane\r\nmove as her breast heaved.  By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at\r\nher intently.  The velvet band again covered the red mark.  I asked\r\nthe Professor in a whisper, "What do you make of that mark on her\r\nthroat?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What do you make of it?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I have not examined it yet," I answered, and then and there proceeded\r\nto loose the band.  Just over the external jugular vein there were two\r\npunctures, not large, but not wholesome looking.  There was no sign of\r\ndisease, but the edges were white and worn looking, as if by some\r\ntrituration.  It at once occurred to me that that this wound, or\r\nwhatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood.\r\nBut I abandoned the idea as soon as it formed, for such a thing could\r\nnot be.  The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the\r\nblood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had\r\nbefore the transfusion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well?" said Van Helsing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well," said I.  "I can make nothing of it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor stood up.  "I must go back to Amsterdam tonight," he\r\nsaid "There are books and things there which I want.  You must remain\r\nhere all night, and you must not let your sight pass from her."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Shall I have a nurse?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We are the best nurses, you and I.  You keep watch all night.  See\r\nthat she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her.  You must not\r\nsleep all the night.  Later on we can sleep, you and I.  I shall be\r\nback as soon as possible.  And then we may begin."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"May begin?" I said.  "What on earth do you mean?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We shall see!" he answered, as he hurried out.  He came back a moment\r\nlater and put his head inside the door and said with a warning finger\r\nheld up, "Remember, she is your charge.  If you leave her, and harm\r\nbefall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY--CONTINUED\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n8 September.--I sat up all night with Lucy.  The opiate worked itself\r\noff towards dusk, and she waked naturally.  She looked a different\r\nbeing from what she had been before the operation.  Her spirits even\r\nwere good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see\r\nevidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone.  When I\r\ntold Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit\r\nup with her, she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her\r\ndaughter''s renewed strength and excellent spirits.  I was firm,\r\nhowever, and made preparations for my long vigil.  When her maid had\r\nprepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had\r\nsupper, and took a seat by the bedside.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully\r\nwhenever I caught her eye.  After a long spell she seemed sinking off\r\nto sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook\r\nit off.  It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled\r\nthe subject at once.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You do not want to sleep?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No.  I am afraid."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Afraid to go to sleep!  Why so?  It is the boon we all crave for."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Ah, not if you were like me, if sleep was to you a presage of\r\nhorror!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"A presage of horror!  What on earth do you mean?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I don''t know.  Oh, I don''t know.  And that is what is so terrible.\r\nAll this weakness comes to me in sleep, until I dread the very\r\nthought."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But, my dear girl, you may sleep tonight.  I am here watching you,\r\nand I can promise that nothing will happen."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Ah, I can trust you!" she said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI seized the opportunity, and said, "I promise that if I see any\r\nevidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You will?  Oh, will you really?  How good you are to me.  Then I will\r\nsleep!"  And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and\r\nsank back, asleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll night long I watched by her.  She never stirred, but slept on and\r\non in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep.  Her lips\r\nwere slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity\r\nof a pendulum.  There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that\r\nno bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took\r\nmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things.  I sent a short\r\nwire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent\r\nresult of the operation.  My own work, with its manifold arrears, took\r\nme all day to clear off.  It was dark when I was able to inquire about\r\nmy zoophagous patient.  The report was good.  He had been quite quiet\r\nfor the past day and night.  A telegram came from Van Helsing at\r\nAmsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at\r\nHillingham tonight, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating\r\nthat he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the\r\nmorning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n9 September.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to\r\nHillingham.  For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my\r\nbrain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral\r\nexhaustion.  Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits.  When she shook\r\nhands with me she looked sharply in my face and said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No sitting up tonight for you.  You are worn out.  I am quite well\r\nagain.  Indeed, I am, and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I\r\nwho will sit up with you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI would not argue the point, but went and had my supper.  Lucy came\r\nwith me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent\r\nmeal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port.\r\nThen Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a\r\ncozy fire was burning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Now," she said.  "You must stay here.  I shall leave this door open\r\nand my door too.  You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing\r\nwould induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient\r\nabove the horizon.  If I want anything I shall call out, and you can\r\ncome to me at once."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could not but acquiesce, for I was dog tired, and could not have sat\r\nup had I tried.  So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she\r\nshould want anything, I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about\r\neverything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLUCY WESTENRA''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n9 September.--I feel so happy tonight.  I have been so miserably weak,\r\nthat to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after\r\na long spell of east wind out of a steel sky.  Somehow Arthur feels\r\nvery, very close to me.  I seem to feel his presence warm about me.  I\r\nsuppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn\r\nour inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength\r\ngive love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he\r\nwills.  I know where my thoughts are.  If only Arthur knew!  My dear,\r\nmy dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking.  Oh,\r\nthe blissful rest of last night!  How I slept, with that dear, good\r\nDr. Seward watching me.  And tonight I shall not fear to sleep, since\r\nhe is close at hand and within call.  Thank everybody for being so\r\ngood to me.  Thank God!  Goodnight Arthur.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n10 September.--I was conscious of the Professor''s hand on my head, and\r\nstarted awake all in a second.  That is one of the things that we\r\nlearn in an asylum, at any rate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And how is our patient?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me," I answered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Come, let us see," he said.  And together we went into the room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van\r\nHelsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I\r\nheard the Professor''s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity,\r\na deadly fear shot through my heart.  As I passed over he moved back,\r\nand his exclamation of horror, "Gott in Himmel!" needed no enforcement\r\nfrom his agonized face.  He raised his hand and pointed to the bed,\r\nand his iron face was drawn and ashen white.  I felt my knees begin to\r\ntremble.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly\r\nwhite and wan-looking than ever.  Even the lips were white, and the\r\ngums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see\r\nin a corpse after a prolonged illness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his\r\nlife and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down\r\nagain softly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Quick!" he said.  "Bring the brandy."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI flew to the dining room, and returned with the decanter.  He wetted\r\nthe poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and\r\nheart.  He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonizing\r\nsuspense said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is not too late.  It beats, though but feebly.  All our work is\r\nundone.  We must begin again.  There is no young Arthur here now.  I\r\nhave to call on you yourself this time, friend John."  As he spoke, he\r\nwas dipping into his bag, and producing the instruments of\r\ntransfusion.  I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve.\r\nThere was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of\r\none; and so, without a moment''s delay, we began the operation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a time, it did not seem a short time either, for the draining\r\naway of one''s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a\r\nterrible feeling, Van Helsing held up a warning finger.  "Do not\r\nstir," he said.  "But I fear that with growing strength she may wake,\r\nand that would make danger, oh, so much danger.  But I shall\r\nprecaution take.  I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia."  He\r\nproceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly\r\ninto the narcotic sleep.  It was with a feeling of personal pride that\r\nI could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks\r\nand lips.  No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel\r\nhis own lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor watched me critically.  "That will do," he said.\r\n"Already?" I remonstrated.  "You took a great deal more from Art."  To\r\nwhich he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He is her lover, her fiance.  You have work, much work to do for her\r\nand for others, and the present will suffice."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied\r\ndigital pressure to my own incision.  I laid down, while I waited his\r\nleisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick.  By and\r\nby he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine\r\nfor myself.  As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half\r\nwhispered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Mind, nothing must be said of this.  If our young lover should turn\r\nup unexpected, as before, no word to him.  It would at once frighten\r\nhim and enjealous him, too.  There must be none.  So!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said, "You are\r\nnot much the worse.  Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest\r\nawhile, then have much breakfast and come here to me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were.  I\r\nhad done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength.  I\r\nfelt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at\r\nwhat had occurred.  I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over\r\nand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how\r\nshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign any where to\r\nshow for it.  I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams,\r\nfor, sleeping and waking my thoughts always came back to the little\r\npunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their\r\nedges, tiny though they were.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well\r\nand strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before.  When Van\r\nHelsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge,\r\nwith strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment.  I\r\ncould hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest\r\ntelegraph office.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that\r\nanything had happened.  I tried to keep her amused and interested.\r\nWhen her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any\r\nchange whatever, but said to me gratefully,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really\r\nmust now take care not to overwork yourself.  You are looking pale\r\nyourself.  You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit, that you\r\ndo!"  As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only\r\nmomentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long an\r\nunwonted drain to the head.  The reaction came in excessive pallor as\r\nshe turned imploring eyes on me.  I smiled and nodded, and laid my\r\nfinger on my lips.  With a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:\r\n"Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough.  Make yourself\r\nstrong.  I stay here tonight, and I shall sit up with little miss\r\nmyself.  You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to\r\nknow.  I have grave reasons.  No, do not ask me.  Think what you will.\r\nDo not fear to think even the most not-improbable.  Goodnight."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either\r\nof them might not sit up with Miss Lucy.  They implored me to let\r\nthem, and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing''s wish that either he or\r\nI should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with\r\nthe ''foreign gentleman''.  I was much touched by their kindness.  Perhaps\r\nit is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on\r\nLucy''s account, that their devotion was manifested.  For over and over\r\nagain have I seen similar instances of woman''s kindness.  I got back\r\nhere in time for a late dinner, went my rounds, all well, and set this\r\ndown whilst waiting for sleep.  It is coming.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n11 September.--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham.  Found Van\r\nHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better.  Shortly after I\r\nhad arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor.  He\r\nopened it with much impressment, assumed, of course, and showed a\r\ngreat bundle of white flowers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"These are for you, Miss Lucy," he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"For me?  Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with.  These are medicines."\r\nHere Lucy made a wry face.  "Nay, but they are not to take in a\r\ndecoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming\r\nnose, or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have\r\nto endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort.\r\nAha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again.\r\nThis is medicinal, but you do not know how.  I put him in your window,\r\nI make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so you sleep well.\r\nOh, yes!  They, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten.\r\nIt smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth\r\nthat the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all\r\ntoo late."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and\r\nsmelling them.  Now she threw them down saying, with half laughter,\r\nand half disgust,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me.  Why,\r\nthese flowers are only common garlic."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness,\r\nhis iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No trifling with me!  I never jest!  There is grim purpose in what I\r\ndo, and I warn you that you do not thwart me.  Take care, for the sake\r\nof others if not for your own."  Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she\r\nmight well be, he went on more gently, "Oh, little miss, my dear, do\r\nnot fear me.  I only do for your good, but there is much virtue to you\r\nin those so common flowers.  See, I place them myself in your room.  I\r\nmake myself the wreath that you are to wear.  But hush!  No telling to\r\nothers that make so inquisitive questions.  We must obey, and silence\r\nis a part of obedience, and obedience is to bring you strong and well\r\ninto loving arms that wait for you.  Now sit still a while.  Come with\r\nme, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic,\r\nwhich is all the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise\r\nherb in his glass houses all the year.  I had to telegraph yesterday,\r\nor they would not have been here."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe went into the room, taking the flowers with us.  The Professor''s\r\nactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopeia\r\nthat I ever heard of.  First he fastened up the windows and latched\r\nthem securely.  Next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them\r\nall over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that\r\nmight get in would be laden with the garlic smell.  Then with the wisp\r\nhe rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each\r\nside, and round the fireplace in the same way.  It all seemed\r\ngrotesque to me, and presently I said, "Well, Professor, I know you\r\nalways have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me.\r\nIt is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were\r\nworking some spell to keep out an evil spirit."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Perhaps I am!" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath\r\nwhich Lucy was to wear round her neck.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she\r\nwas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her\r\nneck.  The last words he said to her were,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Take care you do not disturb it, and even if the room feel close, do\r\nnot tonight open the window or the door."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I promise," said Lucy.  "And thank you both a thousand times for all\r\nyour kindness to me!  Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such\r\nfriends?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said,\r\n"Tonight I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want, two nights of travel,\r\nmuch reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to\r\nfollow, and a night to sit up, without to wink.  Tomorrow in the\r\nmorning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty\r\nmiss, so much more strong for my ''spell'' which I have work.  Ho, ho!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two\r\nnights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror.\r\nIt must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my\r\nfriend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

I quite love that dear\r\nDr. Van Helsing.  I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers.\r\nHe positively frightened me, he was so fierce.  And yet he must have\r\nbeen right, for I feel comfort from them already.  Somehow, I do not\r\ndread being alone tonight, and I can go to sleep without fear.  I\r\nshall not mind any flapping outside the window.  Oh, the terrible\r\nstruggle that I have had against sleep so often of late, the pain of\r\nsleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, and with such unknown\r\nhorrors as it has for me!  How blessed are some people, whose lives\r\nhave no fears, no dreads, to whom sleep is a blessing that comes\r\nnightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.  Well, here I am\r\ntonight, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with\r\n''virgin crants and maiden strewments.''  I never liked garlic before,\r\nbut tonight it is delightful!  There is peace in its smell.  I feel\r\nsleep coming already.  Goodnight, everybody.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n13 September.--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,\r\nup to time.  The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting.  The\r\nProfessor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLet all be put down exactly.  Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham\r\nat eight o''clock.  It was a lovely morning.  The bright sunshine and\r\nall the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of\r\nnature''s annual work.  The leaves were turning to all kinds of\r\nbeautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees.  When\r\nwe entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room.  She\r\nis always an early riser.  She greeted us warmly and said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better.  The dear child is\r\nstill asleep.  I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in,\r\nlest I should disturb her."  The Professor smiled, and looked quite\r\njubilant.  He rubbed his hands together, and said, "Aha!  I thought I\r\nhad diagnosed the case.  My treatment is working."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo which she replied, "You must not take all the credit to yourself,\r\ndoctor.  Lucy''s state this morning is due in part to me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How do you mean, ma''am?" asked the Professor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into\r\nher room.  She was sleeping soundly, so soundly that even my coming\r\ndid not wake her.  But the room was awfully stuffy.  There were a lot\r\nof those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she\r\nhad actually a bunch of them round her neck.  I feared that the heavy\r\nodour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took\r\nthem all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh\r\nair.  You will be pleased with her, I am sure."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early.\r\nAs she had spoken, I watched the Professor''s face, and saw it turn\r\nashen gray.  He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the\r\npoor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a\r\nshock would be.  He actually smiled on her as he held open the door\r\nfor her to pass into her room.  But the instant she had disappeared he\r\npulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining room and closed the\r\ndoor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down.  He\r\nraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then\r\nbeat his palms together in a helpless way.  Finally he sat down on a\r\nchair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud,\r\ndry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole\r\nuniverse.  "God!  God!  God!" he said.  "What have we done, what has\r\nthis poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?  Is there fate\r\namongst us still, send down from the pagan world of old, that such\r\nthings must be, and in such way?  This poor mother, all unknowing, and\r\nall for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter\r\nbody and soul, and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or\r\nshe die, then both die.  Oh, how we are beset!  How are all the powers\r\nof the devils against us!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly he jumped to his feet.  "Come," he said, "come, we must see and\r\nact.  Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not.\r\nWe must fight him all the same."  He went to the hall door for his\r\nbag, and together we went up to Lucy''s room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the\r\nbed.  This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with\r\nthe same awful, waxen pallor as before.  He wore a look of stern\r\nsadness and infinite pity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"As I expected," he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his\r\nwhich meant so much.  Without a word he went and locked the door, and\r\nthen began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet\r\nanother operation of transfusion of blood.  I had long ago recognized\r\nthe necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a\r\nwarning hand.  "No!" he said.  "Today you must operate.  I shall\r\nprovide.  You are weakened already."  As he spoke he took off his coat\r\nand rolled up his shirtsleeve.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAgain the operation.  Again the narcotic.  Again some return of colour\r\nto the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep.  This\r\ntime I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPresently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she\r\nmust not remove anything from Lucy''s room without consulting him.\r\nThat the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of\r\ntheir odour was a part of the system of cure.  Then he took over the\r\ncare of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and\r\nthe next, and would send me word when to come.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and\r\nseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat does it all mean?  I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of\r\nlife amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLUCY WESTENRA''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n17 September.--Four days and nights of peace.  I am getting so strong\r\nagain that I hardly know myself.  It is as if I had passed through\r\nsome long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful\r\nsunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me.  I have a\r\ndim half remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing,\r\ndarkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present\r\ndistress more poignant.  And then long spells of oblivion, and the\r\nrising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of\r\nwater.  Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad\r\ndreaming seems to have passed away.  The noises that used to frighten\r\nme out of my wits, the flapping against the windows, the distant\r\nvoices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I\r\nknow not where and commanded me to do I know not what, have all\r\nceased.  I go to bed now without any fear of sleep.  I do not even try\r\nto keep awake.  I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful\r\narrives for me every day from Haarlem.  Tonight Dr. Van Helsing is\r\ngoing away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam.  But I need not be\r\nwatched.  I am well enough to be left alone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThank God for Mother''s sake, and dear Arthur''s, and for all our\r\nfriends who have been so kind!  I shall not even feel the change, for\r\nlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time.  I\r\nfound him asleep twice when I awoke.  But I did not fear to go to\r\nsleep again, although the boughs or bats or something flapped almost\r\nangrily against the window panes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTHE PALL MALL GAZETTE 18 September.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTHE ESCAPED WOLF PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nINTERVIEW WITH THE KEEPER IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually\r\nusing the words ''PALL MALL GAZETTE'' as a sort of talisman, I managed\r\nto find the keeper of the section of the Zoological Gardens in which\r\nthe wolf department is included.  Thomas Bilder lives in one of the\r\ncottages in the enclosure behind the elephant house, and was just\r\nsitting down to his tea when I found him.  Thomas and his wife are\r\nhospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen\r\nI enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives\r\nmust be pretty comfortable.  The keeper would not enter on what he\r\ncalled business until the supper was over, and we were all\r\nsatisfied.  Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his\r\npipe, he said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Now, Sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want.  You''ll excoose\r\nme refoosin'' to talk of perfeshunal subjucts afore meals.  I gives\r\nthe wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their\r\ntea afore I begins to arsk them questions."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How do you mean, ask them questions?" I queried, wishful to get him\r\ninto a talkative humor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''Ittin'' of them over the ''ead with a pole is one way.  Scratchin'' of\r\ntheir ears in another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf\r\nto their gals.  I don''t so much mind the fust, the ''ittin of the\r\npole part afore I chucks in their dinner, but I waits till they''ve\r\n''ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the\r\near scratchin''.  Mind you," he added philosophically, "there''s a\r\ndeal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here''s you\r\na-comin'' and arskin'' of me questions about my business, and I that\r\ngrump-like that only for your bloomin'' ''arf-quid I''d ''a'' seen you\r\nblowed fust ''fore I''d answer.  Not even when you arsked me sarcastic\r\nlike if I''d like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me\r\nquestions.  Without offence did I tell yer to go to ''ell?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You did."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"An'' when you said you''d report me for usin'' obscene language that\r\nwas ''ittin'' me over the ''ead.  But the ''arf-quid made that all\r\nright.  I weren''t a-goin'' to fight, so I waited for the food, and\r\ndid with my ''owl as the wolves and lions and tigers does.  But, lor''\r\nlove yer ''art, now that the old ''ooman has stuck a chunk of her\r\ntea-cake in me, an'' rinsed me out with her bloomin'' old teapot, and I''ve\r\nlit hup, you may scratch my ears for all you''re worth, and won''t\r\neven get a growl out of me.  Drive along with your questions.  I\r\nknow what yer a-comin'' at, that ''ere escaped wolf."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Exactly.  I want you to give me your view of it.  Just tell me how\r\nit happened, and when I know the facts I''ll get you to say what you\r\nconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair\r\nwill end."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"All right, guv''nor.  This ''ere is about the ''ole story.\r\nThat ''ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three gray\r\nones that came from Norway to Jamrach''s, which we bought\r\noff him four years ago.  He was a nice well-behaved wolf,\r\nthat never gave no trouble to talk of.  I''m more surprised\r\nat ''im for wantin'' to get out nor any other animile in the\r\nplace.  But, there, you can''t trust wolves no more nor women."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Don''t you mind him, Sir!" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery\r\nlaugh.  "''E''s got mindin'' the animiles so long that blest\r\nif he ain''t like a old wolf ''isself!  But there ain''t no\r\n''arm in ''im."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, Sir, it was about two hours after feedin'' yesterday when I\r\nfirst hear my disturbance.  I was makin'' up a litter in the monkey\r\nhouse for a young puma which is ill.  But when I heard the yelpin''\r\nand ''owlin'' I kem away straight.  There was Bersicker a-tearin'' like\r\na mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out.  There wasn''t\r\nmuch people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a\r\ntall, thin chap, with a ''ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few\r\nwhite hairs runnin'' through it.  He had a ''ard, cold look and red\r\neyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him, for it seemed as if it\r\nwas ''im as they was hirritated at.  He ''ad white kid gloves on ''is\r\n''ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says, ''Keeper,\r\nthese wolves seem upset at something.''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''Maybe it''s you,'' says I, for I did not like the airs as he\r\ngive ''isself.  He didn''t get angry, as I ''oped he would, but\r\nhe smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white,\r\nsharp teeth.  ''Oh no, they wouldn''t like me,'' ''e says.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''Ow yes, they would,'' says I, a-imitatin'' of him.  ''They\r\nalways like a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea\r\ntime, which you ''as a bagful.''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us\r\na-talkin'' they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker\r\nhe let me stroke his ears same as ever.  That there man kem\r\nover, and blessed but if he didn''t put in his hand and stroke\r\nthe old wolf''s ears too!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''Tyke care,'' says I. ''Bersicker is quick.''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''Never mind,'' he says.  I''m used to ''em!''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''Are you in the business yourself?'' I says, tyking off my\r\n''at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good\r\nfriend to keepers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''Nom,'' says he, ''not exactly in the business, but I ''ave made pets\r\nof several.''  And with that he lifts his ''at as perlite as a lord,\r\nand walks away.  Old Bersicker kep'' a-lookin'' arter ''im till ''e was\r\nout of sight, and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn''t\r\ncome hout the ''ole hevening.  Well, larst night, so soon as the moon\r\nwas hup, the wolves here all began a-''owling.  There warn''t nothing\r\nfor them to ''owl at.  There warn''t no one near, except some one that\r\nwas evidently a-callin'' a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in\r\nthe Park road.  Once or twice I went out to see that all was right,\r\nand it was, and then the ''owling stopped.  Just before twelve\r\no''clock I just took a look round afore turnin'' in, an'', bust me, but\r\nwhen I kem opposite to old Bersicker''s cage I see the rails broken\r\nand twisted about and the cage empty.  And that''s all I know for\r\ncerting."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Did any one else see anything?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"One of our gard''ners was a-comin'' ''ome about that time from a\r\n''armony, when he sees a big gray dog comin'' out through the garding\r\n''edges.  At least, so he says, but I don''t give much for it myself,\r\nfor if he did ''e never said a word about it to his missis when ''e\r\ngot ''ome, and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made\r\nknown, and we had been up all night a-huntin'' of the Park for\r\nBersicker, that he remembered seein'' anything.  My own belief was\r\nthat the ''armony ''ad got into his ''ead."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape\r\nof the wolf?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, Sir," he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, "I think I\r\ncan, but I don''t know as ''ow you''d be satisfied with the theory."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Certainly I shall.  If a man like you, who knows the animals from\r\nexperience, can''t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to\r\ntry?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well then, Sir, I accounts for it this way.  It seems to me that\r\n''ere wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the\r\njoke I could see that it had done service before, and that the whole\r\nexplanation was simply an elaborate sell.  I couldn''t cope in\r\nbadinage with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to\r\nhis heart, so I said, "Now, Mr. Bilder, we''ll consider that first\r\nhalf-sovereign worked off, and this brother of his is waiting to be\r\nclaimed when you''ve told me what you think will happen."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Right y''are, Sir," he said briskly.  "Ye''ll excoose me, I\r\nknow, for a-chaffin'' of ye, but the old woman here winked at\r\nme, which was as much as telling me to go on."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, I never!" said the old lady.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My opinion is this: that ''ere wolf is a''idin'' of, somewheres.  The\r\ngard''ner wot didn''t remember said he was a-gallopin'' northward\r\nfaster than a horse could go, but I don''t believe him, for, yer see,\r\nSir, wolves don''t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein'' built\r\nthat way.  Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when\r\nthey gets in packs and does be chivyin'' somethin'' that''s more\r\nafeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it\r\nup, whatever it is.  But, Lor'' bless you, in real life a wolf is\r\nonly a low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good dog, and\r\nnot half a quarter so much fight in ''im.  This one ain''t been used\r\nto fightin'' or even to providin'' for hisself, and more like he''s\r\nsomewhere round the Park a''hidin'' an'' a''shiverin'' of, and if he\r\nthinks at all, wonderin'' where he is to get his breakfast from.  Or\r\nmaybe he''s got down some area and is in a coal cellar.  My eye,\r\nwon''t some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes\r\na-shinin'' at her out of the dark!  If he can''t get food he''s bound to\r\nlook for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher''s shop\r\nin time.  If he doesn''t, and some nursemaid goes out walkin'' or orf\r\nwith a soldier, leavin'' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well,\r\nthen I shouldn''t be surprised if the census is one babby the less.\r\nThat''s all."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up\r\nagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder''s face doubled its natural length\r\nwith surprise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"God bless me!" he said.  "If there ain''t old Bersicker come back by\r\n''isself!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe went to the door and opened it, a most unnecessary proceeding it\r\nseemed to me.  I have always thought that a wild animal never looks\r\nso well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between\r\nus.  A personal experience has intensified rather than diminished\r\nthat idea.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder\r\nnor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog.\r\nThe animal itself was a peaceful and well-behaved as that father of\r\nall picture-wolves, Red Riding Hood''s quondam friend, whilst moving\r\nher confidence in masquerade.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe whole scene was a unutterable mixture of comedy and\r\npathos.  The wicked wolf that for a half a day had\r\nparalyzed London and set all the children in town shivering\r\nin their shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and\r\nwas received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal\r\nson.  Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender\r\nsolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent\r\nsaid,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of\r\ntrouble.  Didn''t I say it all along?  Here''s his head all\r\ncut and full of broken glass.  ''E''s been a-gettin'' over\r\nsome bloomin'' wall or other.  It''s a shyme that people are\r\nallowed to top their walls with broken bottles.  This ''ere''s\r\nwhat comes of it.  Come along, Bersicker."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece\r\nof meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary\r\nconditions of the fatted calf, and went off to report.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI came off too, to report the only exclusive information\r\nthat is given today regarding the strange escapade at the\r\nZoo.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n17 September.--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my\r\nbooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,\r\nhad fallen sadly into arrear.  Suddenly the door was burst open, and\r\nin rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion.  I was\r\nthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord\r\ninto the Superintendent''s study is almost unknown.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWithout an instant''s notice he made straight at me.  He had a dinner\r\nknife in his hand, and as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the\r\ntable between us.  He was too quick and too strong for me, however,\r\nfor before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left\r\nwrist rather severely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore he could strike again, however, I got in my right hand and he\r\nwas sprawling on his back on the floor.  My wrist bled freely, and\r\nquite a little pool trickled on to the carpet.  I saw that my friend\r\nwas not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my\r\nwrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time.  When\r\nthe attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his\r\nemployment positively sickened me.  He was lying on his belly on the\r\nfloor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my\r\nwounded wrist.  He was easily secured, and to my surprise, went with\r\nthe attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again,\r\n"The blood is the life!  The blood is the life!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI cannot afford to lose blood just at present.  I have lost too much\r\nof late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy''s\r\nillness and its horrible phases is telling on me.  I am over excited\r\nand weary, and I need rest, rest, rest.  Happily Van Helsing has not\r\nsummoned me, so I need not forego my sleep.  Tonight I could not well\r\ndo without it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTELEGRAM, VAN HELSING, ANTWERP, TO SEWARD, CARFAX\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given, delivered late\r\nby twenty-two hours.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n17 September.--Do not fail to be at Hilllingham tonight.\r\nIf not watching all the time, frequently visit and see that\r\nflowers are as placed, very important, do not fail.

The arrival of Van\r\nHelsing''s telegram filled me with dismay.  A whole night lost,\r\nand I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night.\r\nOf course it is possible that all may be well, but what may\r\nhave happened?  Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us\r\nthat every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do.\r\nI shall take this cylinder with me, and then I can complete\r\nmy entry on Lucy''s phonograph.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMEMORANDUM LEFT BY LUCY WESTENRA\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n17 September, Night.--I write this and leave it to be seen,\r\nso that no one may by any chance get into trouble through\r\nme.  This is an exact record of what took place tonight.  I\r\nfeel I am dying of weakness, and have barely strength to\r\nwrite, but it must be done if I die in the doing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were\r\nplaced as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after\r\nthat sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and\r\nwhich now I know so well.  I was not afraid, but I did wish that\r\nDr. Seward was in the next room, as Dr. Van Helsing said he would\r\nbe, so that I might have called him.  I tried to sleep, but I\r\ncould not.  Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I\r\ndetermined to keep awake.  Perversely sleep would try to come then\r\nwhen I did not want it.  So, as I feared to be alone, I opened my\r\ndoor and called out, "Is there anybody there?"  There was no\r\nanswer.  I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door\r\nagain.  Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like\r\na dog''s, but more fierce and deeper.  I went to the window and\r\nlooked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had\r\nevidently been buffeting its wings against the window.  So I went\r\nback to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep.  Presently\r\nthe door opened, and mother looked in.  Seeing by my moving that\r\nI was not asleep, she came in and sat by me.  She said to me even\r\nmore sweetly and softly than her wont,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that\r\nyou were all right."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her\r\nto come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay\r\ndown beside me.  She did not take off her dressing gown,\r\nfor she said she would only stay a while and then go back\r\nto her own bed.  As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers\r\nthe flapping and buffeting came to the window again.  She\r\nwas startled and a little frightened, and cried out, "What\r\nis that?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay\r\nquiet.  But I could hear her poor dear heart still beating\r\nterribly.  After a while there was the howl again out in\r\nthe shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the\r\nwindow, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.\r\nThe window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in,\r\nand in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head\r\nof a great, gaunt gray wolf.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a\r\nsitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would\r\nhelp her.  Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of\r\nflowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round\r\nmy neck, and tore it away from me.  For a second or two she\r\nsat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and\r\nhorrible gurgling in her throat.  Then she fell over, as if\r\nstruck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and\r\nmade me dizzy for a moment or two.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe room and all round seemed to spin round.  I kept my eyes\r\nfixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole\r\nmyriad of little specks seems to come blowing in through the\r\nbroken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of\r\ndust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the\r\ndesert.  I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and\r\ndear Mother''s poor body, which seemed to grow cold already, for\r\nher dear heart had ceased to beat, weighed me down, and I\r\nremembered no more for a while.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I\r\nrecovered consciousness again.  Somewhere near, a passing\r\nbell was tolling.  The dogs all round the neighbourhood were\r\nhowling, and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a\r\nnightingale was singing.  I was dazed and stupid with pain\r\nand terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale\r\nseemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me.\r\nThe sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could\r\nhear their bare feet pattering outside my door.  I called to\r\nthem, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and\r\nwhat it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out.  The\r\nwind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed\r\nto.  They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her,\r\ncovered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up.  They\r\nwere all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to\r\nthe dining room and each have a glass of wine.  The door flew\r\nopen for an instant and closed again.  The maids shrieked, and\r\nthen went in a body to the dining room, and I laid what flowers I\r\nhad on my dear mother''s breast.  When they were there I\r\nremembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn''t like to\r\nremove them, and besides, I would have some of the servants to\r\nsit up with me now.  I was surprised that the maids did not come\r\nback.  I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining\r\nroom to look for them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy heart sank when I saw what had happened.  They all four\r\nlay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily.  The decanter\r\nof sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer,\r\nacrid smell about.  I was suspicious, and examined the decanter.\r\nIt smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that\r\nthe bottle which Mother''s doctor uses for her--oh! did use--was\r\nempty.  What am I to do? What am I to do?  I am back in the room\r\nwith Mother.  I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the\r\nsleeping servants, whom some one has drugged.  Alone with the\r\ndead! I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf\r\nthrough the broken window.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the\r\ndraught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim.\r\nWhat am I to do?  God shield me from harm this night!  I\r\nshall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find\r\nit when they come to lay me out.  My dear mother gone!  It\r\nis time that I go too.  Goodbye, dear Arthur, if I should\r\nnot survive this night.  God keep you, dear, and God help\r\nme!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n18 September.--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.\r\nKeeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone.  I knocked\r\ngently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy\r\nor her mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door.  After a\r\nwhile, finding no response, I knocked and rang again, still no\r\nanswer.  I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie\r\nabed at such an hour, for it was now ten o''clock, and so rang and\r\nknocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response.\r\nHitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began\r\nto assail me.  Was this desolation but another link in the chain of\r\ndoom which seemed drawing tight round us?  Was it indeed a house of\r\ndeath to which I had come, too late?  I know that minutes, even\r\nseconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had\r\nagain one of those frightful relapses, and I went round the house to\r\ntry if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could find no means of ingress.  Every window and door was fastened\r\nand locked, and I returned baffled to the porch.  As I did so, I heard\r\nthe rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse''s feet.  They stopped at\r\nthe gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the\r\navenue.  When he saw me, he gasped out, "Then it was you, and just\r\narrived.  How is she?  Are we too late?  Did you not get my telegram?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got\r\nhis telegram early in the morning, and had not a minute in coming\r\nhere, and that I could not make any one in the house hear me.  He\r\npaused and raised his hat as he said solemnly, "Then I fear we are too\r\nlate.  God''s will be done!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith his usual recuperative energy, he went on, "Come.  If there be no\r\nway open to get in, we must make one.  Time is all in all to us now."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen\r\nwindow.  The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and\r\nhanding it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window.\r\nI attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them.\r\nThen with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the\r\nsashes and opened the window.  I helped the Professor in, and followed\r\nhim.  There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants'' rooms, which\r\nwere close at hand.  We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in\r\nthe dining room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters,\r\nfound four servant women lying on the floor.  There was no need to\r\nthink them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of\r\nlaudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said,\r\n"We can attend to them later."  Then we ascended to Lucy''s room.  For an\r\ninstant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound\r\nthat we could hear.  With white faces and trembling hands, we opened\r\nthe door gently, and entered the room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHow shall I describe what we saw?  On the bed lay two women, Lucy and\r\nher mother.  The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a\r\nwhite sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the drought\r\nthrough the broken window, showing the drawn, white, face, with a look\r\nof terror fixed upon it.  By her side lay Lucy, with face white and\r\nstill more drawn.  The flowers which had been round her neck we found\r\nupon her mother''s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two\r\nlittle wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white\r\nand mangled.  Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head\r\nalmost touching poor Lucy''s breast.  Then he gave a quick turn of his\r\nhead, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to\r\nme, "It is not yet too late!  Quick!  Quick!  Bring the brandy!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste\r\nit, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I\r\nfound on the table.  The maids were still breathing, but more\r\nrestlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off.  I did\r\nnot stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing.  He rubbed the\r\nbrandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists\r\nand the palms of her hands.  He said to me, "I can do this, all that\r\ncan be at the present.  You go wake those maids.  Flick them in the\r\nface with a wet towel, and flick them hard.  Make them get heat and\r\nfire and a warm bath.  This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside\r\nher.  She will need be heated before we can do anything more."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the\r\nwomen.  The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently\r\naffected her more strongly so I lifted her on the sofa and let her\r\nsleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them\r\nthey cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner.  I was stern with them,\r\nhowever, and would not let them talk.  I told them that one life was\r\nbad enough to lose, and if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss\r\nLucy.  So, sobbing and crying they went about their way, half clad as\r\nthey were, and prepared fire and water.  Fortunately, the kitchen and\r\nboiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water.  We\r\ngot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it.\r\nWhilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall\r\ndoor.  One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and\r\nopened it.  Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a\r\ngentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood.  I bade her\r\nsimply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now.  She\r\nwent away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean\r\nforgot all about him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly\r\nearnest.  I knew, as he knew, that it was a stand-up fight with death,\r\nand in a pause told him so.  He answered me in a way that I did not\r\nunderstand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her\r\nfade away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon."  He\r\nwent on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied\r\nvigour.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPresently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to\r\nbe of some effect.  Lucy''s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the\r\nstethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement.  Van Helsing''s\r\nface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her\r\nin a hot sheet to dry her he said to me, "The first gain is ours!\r\nCheck to the King!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and\r\nlaid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat.  I\r\nnoticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her\r\nthroat.  She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not\r\nworse than, we had ever seen her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her\r\nand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned\r\nme out of the room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We must consult as to what is to be done," he said as we descended\r\nthe stairs.  In the hall he opened the dining room door, and we passed\r\nin, he closing the door carefully behind him.  The shutters had been\r\nopened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the\r\netiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always\r\nrigidly observes.  The room was, therefore, dimly dark.  It was,\r\nhowever, light enough for our purposes.  Van Helsing''s sternness was\r\nsomewhat relieved by a look of perplexity.  He was evidently torturing\r\nhis mind about something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What are we to do now?  Where are we to turn for help?  We must have\r\nanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl''s life\r\nwon''t be worth an hour''s purchase.  You are exhausted already.  I am\r\nexhausted too.  I fear to trust those women, even if they would have\r\ncourage to submit.  What are we to do for some one who will open his\r\nveins for her?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What''s the matter with me, anyhow?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought\r\nrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened\r\nand a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out, "Quincey Morris!"\r\nand rushed towards him with outstretched hands.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What brought you here?" I cried as our hands met.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I guess Art is the cause."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe handed me a telegram.--''Have not heard from Seward for three days,\r\nand am terribly anxious.  Cannot leave.  Father still in same\r\ncondition.  Send me word how Lucy is.  Do not delay.--Holmwood.''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I think I came just in the nick of time.  You know you have only to\r\ntell me what to do."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in\r\nthe eyes as he said, "A brave man''s blood is the best thing on this\r\nearth when a woman is in trouble.  You''re a man and no mistake.  Well,\r\nthe devil may work against us for all he''s worth, but God sends us men\r\nwhen we want them."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce again we went through that ghastly operation.  I have not the\r\nheart to go through with the details.  Lucy had got a terrible shock\r\nand it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went\r\ninto her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as\r\non the other occasions.  Her struggle back into life was something\r\nfrightful to see and hear.  However, the action of both heart and\r\nlungs improved, and Van Helsing made a sub-cutaneous injection of\r\nmorphia, as before, and with good effect.  Her faint became a profound\r\nslumber.  The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey\r\nMorris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who\r\nwere waiting.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the\r\ncook to get ready a good breakfast.  Then a thought struck me, and I\r\nwent back to the room where Lucy now was.  When I came softly in, I\r\nfound Van Helsing with a sheet or two of note paper in his hand.  He\r\nhad evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his\r\nhand to his brow.  There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face,\r\nas of one who has had a doubt solved.  He handed me the paper saying\r\nonly, "It dropped from Lucy''s breast when we carried her to the bath."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a\r\npause asked him, "In God''s name, what does it all mean?  Was she, or\r\nis she, mad, or what sort of horrible danger is it?"  I was so\r\nbewildered that I did not know what to say more.  Van Helsing put out\r\nhis hand and took the paper, saying,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do not trouble about it now.  Forget it for the present.  You shall\r\nknow and understand it all in good time, but it will be later.  And\r\nnow what is it that you came to me to say?"  This brought me back to\r\nfact, and I was all myself again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I came to speak about the certificate of death.  If we do not act\r\nproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would\r\nhave to be produced.  I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for\r\nif we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did.  I\r\nknow, and you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that\r\nMrs. Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she\r\ndied of it.  Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take\r\nit myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good, oh my friend John!  Well thought of!  Truly Miss Lucy, if she\r\nbe sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends\r\nthat love her.  One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides\r\none old man.  Ah, yes, I know, friend John.  I am not blind!  I love\r\nyou all the more for it!  Now go."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling\r\nhim that Mrs. Westenra was dead, that Lucy also had been ill, but was\r\nnow going on better, and that Van Helsing and I were with her.  I told\r\nhim where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to\r\nourselves?"  I nodded in reply and went out.  I found no difficulty\r\nabout the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come\r\nup in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I got back Quincey was waiting for me.  I told him I would see\r\nhim as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room.  She was\r\nstill sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his\r\nseat at her side.  From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered\r\nthat he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of\r\nfore-stalling nature.  So I went down to Quincey and took him into the\r\nbreakfast room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a\r\nlittle more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we were alone, he said to me, "Jack Seward, I don''t want to shove\r\nmyself in anywhere where I''ve no right to be, but this is no ordinary\r\ncase.  You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her, but\r\nalthough that''s all past and gone, I can''t help feeling anxious about\r\nher all the same.  What is it that''s wrong with her?  The Dutchman,\r\nand a fine old fellow he is, I can see that, said that time you two\r\ncame into the room, that you must have another transfusion of blood,\r\nand that both you and he were exhausted.  Now I know well that you\r\nmedical men speak in camera, and that a man must not expect to know\r\nwhat they consult about in private.  But this is no common matter, and\r\nwhatever it is, I have done my part.  Is not that so?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That''s so," I said, and he went on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did\r\ntoday.  Is not that so?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That''s so."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And I guess Art was in it too.  When I saw him four days ago down at\r\nhis own place he looked queer.  I have not seen anything pulled down\r\nso quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of\r\ngo to grass all in a night.  One of those big bats that they call\r\nvampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the\r\nvein left open, there wasn''t enough blood in her to let her stand up,\r\nand I had to put a bullet through her as she lay.  Jack, if you may\r\ntell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not\r\nthat so?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious.  He was in a\r\ntorture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter\r\nignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her\r\nintensified his pain.  His very heart was bleeding, and it took all\r\nthe manhood of him, and there was a royal lot of it, too, to keep him\r\nfrom breaking down.  I paused before answering, for I felt that I must\r\nnot betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret, but\r\nalready he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no\r\nreason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That''s so."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And how long has this been going on?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"About ten days."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Ten days!  Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature\r\nthat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood\r\nof four strong men.  Man alive, her whole body wouldn''t hold it."  Then\r\ncoming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper.  "What took it\r\nout?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shook my head.  "That," I said, "is the crux.  Van Helsing is simply\r\nfrantic about it, and I am at my wits'' end.  I can''t even hazard a\r\nguess.  There has been a series of little circumstances which have\r\nthrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched.\r\nBut these shall not occur again.  Here we stay until all be well, or\r\nill."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nQuincey held out his hand.  "Count me in," he said.  "You and the\r\nDutchman will tell me what to do, and I''ll do it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy''s first movement was to feel\r\nin her breast, and to my surprise, produced the paper which Van\r\nHelsing had given me to read.  The careful Professor had replaced it\r\nwhere it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed.  Her\r\neyes then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened.  Then she\r\nlooked round the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered.  She gave\r\na loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe both understood what was meant, that she had realized to the full\r\nher mother''s death.  So we tried what we could to comfort her.\r\nDoubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought\r\nand spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time.  We told her\r\nthat either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and\r\nthat seemed to comfort her.  Towards dusk she fell into a doze.  Here\r\na very odd thing occurred.  Whilst still asleep she took the paper\r\nfrom her breast and tore it in two.  Van Helsing stepped over and took\r\nthe pieces from her.  All the same, however, she went on with the\r\naction of tearing, as though the material were still in her hands.\r\nFinally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the\r\nfragments.  Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if\r\nin thought, but he said nothing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n19 September.--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid\r\nto sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it.  The Professor\r\nand I took in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment\r\nunattended.  Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I\r\nknew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor\r\nLucy''s strength.  She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little\r\nnourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good.  At times\r\nshe slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her,\r\nbetween sleeping and waking.  Whilst asleep she looked stronger,\r\nalthough more haggard, and her breathing was softer.  Her open mouth\r\nshowed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which looked\r\npositively longer and sharper than usual.  When she woke the softness\r\nof her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own\r\nself, although a dying one.  In the afternoon she asked for Arthur,\r\nand we telegraphed for him.  Quincey went off to meet him at the\r\nstation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he arrived it was nearly six o''clock, and the sun was setting\r\nfull and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and\r\ngave more colour to the pale cheeks.  When he saw her, Arthur was\r\nsimply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak.  In the hours\r\nthat had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that\r\npassed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when\r\nconversation was possible were shortened.  Arthur''s presence, however,\r\nseemed to act as a stimulant.  She rallied a little, and spoke to him\r\nmore brightly than she had done since we arrived.  He too pulled\r\nhimself together, and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best\r\nwas made of everything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is now nearly one o''clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with\r\nher.  I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering\r\nthis on Lucy''s phonograph.  Until six o''clock they are to try to rest.\r\nI fear that tomorrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too\r\ngreat.  The poor child cannot rally.  God help us all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(Unopened by her)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n17 September\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy dearest Lucy,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since I\r\nwrote.  You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when\r\nyou have read all my budget of news.  Well, I got my husband back\r\nall right.  When we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage\r\nwaiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr.\r\nHawkins.  He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us\r\nall nice and comfortable, and we dined together.  After dinner\r\nMr. Hawkins said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity, and\r\nmay every blessing attend you both.  I know you both from\r\nchildren, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up.\r\nNow I want you to make your home here with me.  I have left\r\nto me neither chick nor child.  All are gone, and in my\r\nwill I have left you everything.''  I cried, Lucy dear, as\r\nJonathan and the old man clasped hands.  Our evening was a\r\nvery, very happy one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and\r\nfrom both my bedroom and the drawing room I can see the\r\ngreat elms of the cathedral close, with their great black\r\nstems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral,\r\nand I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and\r\nchattering and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner\r\nof rooks--and humans.  I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging\r\nthings and housekeeping.  Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all\r\nday, for now that Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to\r\ntell him all about the clients.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How is your dear mother getting on?  I wish I could run up\r\nto town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not\r\ngo yet, with so much on my shoulders, and Jonathan wants\r\nlooking after still.  He is beginning to put some flesh on\r\nhis bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long\r\nillness.  Even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in\r\na sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him\r\nback to his usual placidity.  However, thank God, these\r\noccasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and they\r\nwill in time pass away altogether, I trust.  And now I have\r\ntold you my news, let me ask yours.  When are you to be\r\nmarried, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and\r\nwhat are you to wear, and is it to be a public or private\r\nwedding?  Tell me all about it, dear, tell me all about\r\neverything, for there is nothing which interests you which\r\nwill not be dear to me.  Jonathan asks me to send his ''respectful\r\nduty'', but I do not think that is good enough from the junior\r\npartner of the important firm Hawkins &amp; Harker.  And so, as you\r\nlove me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and\r\ntenses of the verb, I send you simply his ''love'' instead.\r\nGoodbye, my dearest Lucy, and blessings on you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yours,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Mina Harker"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nREPORT FROM PATRICK HENNESSEY, MD, MRCSLK, QCPI, ETC, ETC,\r\nTO JOHN SEWARD, MD\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n20 September\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy dear Sir:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the\r\nconditions of everything left in my charge.  With regard to\r\npatient, Renfield, there is more to say.  He has had another\r\noutbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as\r\nit fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results.\r\nThis afternoon a carrier''s cart with two men made a call at the\r\nempty house whose grounds abut on ours, the house to which, you\r\nwill remember, the patient twice ran away.  The men stopped at\r\nour gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I was myself looking out of the study window, having a\r\nsmoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the\r\nhouse.  As he passed the window of Renfield''s room, the\r\npatient began to rate him from within, and called him all\r\nthe foul names he could lay his tongue to.  The man, who\r\nseemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling\r\nhim to ''shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar'', whereon our man\r\naccused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and\r\nsaid that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it.\r\nI opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so\r\nhe contented himself after looking the place over and making up\r\nhis mind as to what kind of place he had got to by saying, ''Lor''\r\nbless yer, sir, I wouldn''t mind what was said to me in a bloomin''\r\nmadhouse.  I pity ye and the guv''nor for havin'' to live in the\r\nhouse with a wild beast like that.''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where\r\nthe gate of the empty house was.  He went away followed by\r\nthreats and curses and revilings from our man.  I went down\r\nto see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since\r\nhe is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent\r\nfits nothing of the kind had ever occurred.  I found him, to my\r\nastonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner.  I\r\ntried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me\r\nquestions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was\r\ncompletely oblivious of the affair.  It was, I am sorry to say,\r\nhowever, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an\r\nhour I heard of him again.  This time he had broken out through\r\nthe window of his room, and was running down the avenue.  I\r\ncalled to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I\r\nfeared he was intent on some mischief.  My fear was justified\r\nwhen I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the\r\nroad, having on it some great wooden boxes.  The men were wiping\r\ntheir foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent\r\nexercise.  Before I could get up to him, the patient rushed at\r\nthem, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his\r\nhead against the ground.  If I had not seized him just at the\r\nmoment, I believe he would have killed the man there and then.\r\nThe other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with\r\nthe butt end of his heavy whip.  It was a horrible blow, but he\r\ndid not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with\r\nthe three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens.\r\nYou know I am no lightweight, and the others were both burly men.\r\nAt first he was silent in his fighting, but as we began to master\r\nhim, and the attendants were putting a strait waistcoat on him,\r\nhe began to shout, ''I''ll frustrate them! They shan''t rob me!\r\nThey shan''t murder me by inches!  I''ll fight for my Lord and\r\nMaster!'' and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings.  It was\r\nwith very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the\r\nhouse and put him in the padded room.  One of the attendants,\r\nHardy, had a finger broken.  However, I set it all right, and he\r\nis going on well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of\r\nactions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties\r\nof the law on us.  Their threats were, however, mingled\r\nwith some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the\r\ntwo of them by a feeble madman.  They said that if it had\r\nnot been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying\r\nand raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made\r\nshort work of him.  They gave as another reason for their defeat\r\nthe extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced\r\nby the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible\r\ndistance from the scene of their labors of any place of public\r\nentertainment.  I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff\r\nglass of strong grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a\r\nsovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that\r\nthey would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of\r\nmeeting so ''bloomin'' good a bloke'' as your correspondent.  I took\r\ntheir names and addresses, in case they might be needed.  They\r\nare as follows:  Jack Smollet, of Dudding''s Rents, King George''s\r\nRoad, Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley''s Row,\r\nGuide Court, Bethnal Green. They are both in the employment of\r\nHarris &amp; Sons, Moving and Shipment Company, Orange Master''s Yard,\r\nSoho.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and\r\nshall wire you at once if there is anything of importance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Believe me, dear Sir,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yours faithfully,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Patrick Hennessey."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA (Unopened by her)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n18 September\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My dearest Lucy,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Such a sad blow has befallen us.  Mr. Hawkins has died very\r\nsuddenly.  Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had\r\nboth come to so love him that it really seems as though we\r\nhad lost a father.  I never knew either father or mother,\r\nso that the dear old man''s death is a real blow to me. Jonathan\r\nis greatly distressed.  It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep\r\nsorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his\r\nlife, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and\r\nleft him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is\r\nwealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on\r\nanother account.  He says the amount of responsibility which it\r\nputs upon him makes him nervous.  He begins to doubt himself.  I\r\ntry to cheer him up, and my belief in him helps him to have a\r\nbelief in himself.  But it is here that the grave shock that he\r\nexperienced tells upon him the most.  Oh, it is too hard that a\r\nsweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his, a nature which\r\nenabled him by our dear, good friend''s aid to rise from clerk to\r\nmaster in a few years, should be so injured that the very essence\r\nof its strength is gone.  Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my\r\ntroubles in the midst of your own happiness, but Lucy dear, I\r\nmust tell someone, for the strain of keeping up a brave and\r\ncheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here\r\nthat I can confide in.  I dread coming up to London, as we must\r\ndo that day after tomorrow, for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will\r\nthat he was to be buried in the grave with his father.  As there\r\nare no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner.\r\nI shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few\r\nminutes.  Forgive me for troubling you.  With all blessings,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Your loving\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Mina Harker"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n20 September.--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry\r\ntonight.  I am too miserable, too low spirited, too sick of the world\r\nand all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard\r\nthis moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death.  And he\r\nhas been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late, Lucy''s\r\nmother and Arthur''s father, and now&#8230; Let me get on with my work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy.  We wanted Arthur\r\nto go to rest also, but he refused at first.  It was only when I told\r\nhim that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we\r\nmust not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer,\r\nthat he agreed to go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing was very kind to him.  "Come, my child," he said.  "Come\r\nwith me.  You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much\r\nmental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of.\r\nYou must not be alone, for to be alone is to be full of fears and\r\nalarms.  Come to the drawing room, where there is a big fire, and\r\nthere are two sofas.  You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and\r\nour sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not\r\nspeak, and even if we sleep."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy''s face,\r\nwhich lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn.  She lay quite\r\nstill, and I looked around the room to see that all was as it should\r\nbe.  I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as\r\nin the other, his purpose of using the garlic.  The whole of the\r\nwindow sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy''s neck, over the silk\r\nhandkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet\r\nof the same odorous flowers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its\r\nworst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums.  Her teeth, in the\r\ndim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in\r\nthe morning.  In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine\r\nteeth looked longer and sharper than the rest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI sat down beside her, and presently she moved uneasily.  At the same\r\nmoment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window.\r\nI went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind.\r\nThere was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by\r\na great bat, which wheeled around, doubtless attracted by the light,\r\nalthough so dim, and every now and again struck the window with its\r\nwings.  When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved\r\nslightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat.  I\r\nreplaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPresently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had\r\nprescribed.  She took but a little, and that languidly.  There did not\r\nseem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength\r\nthat had hitherto so marked her illness.  It struck me as curious that\r\nthe moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close\r\nto her.  It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that\r\nlethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers\r\nfrom her, but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was\r\nno possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours\r\nthat followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated\r\nboth actions many times.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt six o''clock Van Helsing came to relieve me.  Arthur had then fallen\r\ninto a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on.  When he saw Lucy''s\r\nface I could hear the hissing indraw of breath, and he said to me in a\r\nsharp whisper.  "Draw up the blind.  I want light!"  Then he bent down,\r\nand, with his face almost touching Lucy''s, examined her carefully.  He\r\nremoved the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat.\r\nAs he did so he started back and I could hear his ejaculation, "Mein\r\nGott!" as it was smothered in his throat.  I bent over and looked,\r\ntoo, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.  The wounds on\r\nthe throat had absolutely disappeared.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face\r\nat its sternest.  Then he turned to me and said calmly, "She is\r\ndying.  It will not be long now.  It will be much difference, mark me,\r\nwhether she dies conscious or in her sleep.  Wake that poor boy, and\r\nlet him come and see the last.  He trusts us, and we have promised\r\nhim."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went to the dining room and waked him.  He was dazed for a moment,\r\nbut when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the\r\nshutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear.  I assured\r\nhim that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that\r\nboth Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near.  He covered his\r\nface with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he\r\nremained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his\r\nshoulders shook with grief.  I took him by the hand and raised him up.\r\n"Come," I said, "my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude.  It\r\nwill be best and easiest for her."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we came into Lucy''s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with\r\nhis usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making\r\neverything look as pleasing as possible.  He had even brushed Lucy''s\r\nhair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples.  When\r\nwe came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered\r\nsoftly, "Arthur!  Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back.\r\n"No," he whispered, "not yet!  Hold her hand, it will comfort her\r\nmore."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,\r\nwith all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes.  Then\r\ngradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep.  For a little bit\r\nher breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired\r\nchild''s.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed\r\nin the night.  Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and\r\nthe pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than\r\never.  In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened\r\nher eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft,\r\nvoluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips, "Arthur!\r\nOh, my love, I am so glad you have come!  Kiss me!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur bent eagerly over to kiss her, but at that instant Van Helsing,\r\nwho, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and\r\ncatching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury\r\nof strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and\r\nactually hurled him almost across the room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Not on your life!" he said, "not for your living soul and hers!"  And\r\nhe stood between them like a lion at bay.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do\r\nor say, and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realized\r\nthe place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm\r\nas of rage flit like a shadow over her face.  The sharp teeth clamped\r\ntogether.  Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVery shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and\r\nputting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing''s great brown\r\none, drawing it close to her, she kissed it.  "My true friend," she\r\nsaid, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, "My true friend,\r\nand his!  Oh, guard him, and give me peace!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I swear it!" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his\r\nhand, as one who registers an oath.  Then he turned to Arthur, and\r\nsaid to him, "Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on\r\nthe forehead, and only once."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTheir eyes met instead of their lips, and so they parted.  Lucy''s eyes\r\nclosed, and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthur''s\r\narm, and drew him away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then Lucy''s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it\r\nceased.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is all over," said Van Helsing.  "She is dead!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing room, where\r\nhe sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way\r\nthat nearly broke me down to see.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy,\r\nand his face was sterner than ever.  Some change had come over her\r\nbody.  Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and\r\ncheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines.  Even the lips had\r\nlost their deadly pallor.  It was as if the blood, no longer needed\r\nfor the working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death\r\nas little rude as might be.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We thought her dying whilst she slept, and sleeping when she died."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI stood beside Van Helsing, and said, "Ah well, poor girl, there is\r\npeace for her at last.  It is the end!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe turned to me, and said with grave solemnity, "Not so, alas!  Not\r\nso.  It is only the beginning!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered,\r\n"We can do nothing as yet.  Wait and see."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

SEWARD''S DIARY--cont.\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and\r\nher mother might be buried together.  I attended to all the ghastly\r\nformalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff was\r\nafflicted, or blessed, with something of his own obsequious suavity.\r\nEven the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to\r\nme, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out\r\nfrom the death chamber,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir.  It''s quite a privilege to\r\nattend on her.  It''s not too much to say that she will do credit to\r\nour establishment!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away.  This was possible\r\nfrom the disordered state of things in the household.  There were no\r\nrelatives at hand, and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend\r\nat his father''s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should\r\nhave been bidden.  Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it\r\nupon ourselves to examine papers, etc.  He insisted upon looking over\r\nLucy''s papers himself.  I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a\r\nforeigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and\r\nso might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe answered me, "I know, I know.  You forget that I am a lawyer as\r\nwell as a doctor.  But this is not altogether for the law.  You knew\r\nthat, when you avoided the coroner.  I have more than him to avoid.\r\nThere may be papers more, such as this."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs he spoke he took from his pocket book the memorandum which had been\r\nin Lucy''s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.\r\nWestenra, seal all her papers, and write him tonight.  For me, I watch\r\nhere in the room and in Miss Lucy''s old room all night, and I myself\r\nsearch for what may be.  It is not well that her very thoughts go into\r\nthe hands of strangers."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found\r\nthe name and address of Mrs. Westenra''s solicitor and had written to\r\nhim.  All the poor lady''s papers were in order.  Explicit directions\r\nregarding the place of burial were given.  I had hardly sealed the\r\nletter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,\r\nsaying,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Can I help you friend John?  I am free, and if I may, my service is\r\nto you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Have you got what you looked for?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo which he replied, "I did not look for any specific thing.  I only\r\nhoped to find, and find I have, all that there was, only some letters\r\nand a few memoranda, and a diary new begun.  But I have them here, and\r\nwe shall for the present say nothing of them.  I shall see that poor\r\nlad tomorrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we had finished the work in hand, he said to me, "And now, friend\r\nJohn, I think we may to bed.  We want sleep, both you and I, and rest\r\nto recuperate.  Tomorrow we shall have much to do, but for the tonight\r\nthere is no need of us.  Alas!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore turning in we went to look at poor Lucy.  The undertaker had\r\ncertainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small\r\nchapelle ardente.  There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,\r\nand death was made as little repulsive as might be.  The end of the\r\nwinding sheet was laid over the face.  When the Professor bent over\r\nand turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us.\r\nThe tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well.  All\r\nLucy''s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that\r\nhad passed, instead of leaving traces of ''decay''s effacing fingers'',\r\nhad but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not\r\nbelieve my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor looked sternly grave.  He had not loved her as I had,\r\nand there was no need for tears in his eyes.  He said to me, "Remain\r\ntill I return," and left the room.  He came back with a handful of\r\nwild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been\r\nopened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the\r\nbed.  Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold\r\ncrucifix, and placed it over the mouth.  He restored the sheet to its\r\nplace, and we came away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the\r\ndoor, he entered, and at once began to speak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Tomorrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem\r\nknives."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Must we make an autopsy?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes and no.  I want to operate, but not what you think.  Let me tell\r\nyou now, but not a word to another.  I want to cut off her head and\r\ntake out her heart.  Ah!  You a surgeon, and so shocked!  You, whom I\r\nhave seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and\r\ndeath that make the rest shudder.  Oh, but I must not forget, my dear\r\nfriend John, that you loved her, and I have not forgotten it for is I\r\nthat shall operate, and you must not help.  I would like to do it\r\ntonight, but for Arthur I must not.  He will be free after his\r\nfather''s funeral tomorrow, and he will want to see her, to see it.\r\nThen, when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall\r\ncome when all sleep.  We shall unscrew the coffin lid, and shall do\r\nour operation, and then replace all, so that none know, save we\r\nalone."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But why do it at all?  The girl is dead.  Why mutilate her poor body\r\nwithout need?  And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and\r\nnothing to gain by it, no good to her, to us, to science, to human\r\nknowledge, why do it?  Without such it is monstrous."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite\r\ntenderness, "Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart, and I love\r\nyou the more because it does so bleed.  If I could, I would take on\r\nmyself the burden that you do bear.  But there are things that you\r\nknow not, but that you shall know, and bless me for knowing, though\r\nthey are not pleasant things.  John, my child, you have been my friend\r\nnow many years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good\r\ncause?  I may err, I am but man, but I believe in all I do.  Was it\r\nnot for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble\r\ncame?  Yes!  Were you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let\r\nArthur kiss his love, though she was dying, and snatched him away by\r\nall my strength?  Yes!  And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her\r\nso beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my\r\nrough old hand and bless me?  Yes!  And did you not hear me swear\r\npromise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful?  Yes!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do.  You have for many\r\nyears trust me.  You have believe me weeks past, when there be things\r\nso strange that you might have well doubt.  Believe me yet a little,\r\nfriend John.  If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think, and\r\nthat is not perhaps well.  And if I work, as work I shall, no matter\r\ntrust or no trust, without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy\r\nheart and feel oh so lonely when I want all help and courage that may\r\nbe!"  He paused a moment and went on solemnly, "Friend John, there are\r\nstrange and terrible days before us.  Let us not be two, but one, that\r\nso we work to a good end.  Will you not have faith in me?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI took his hand, and promised him.  I held my door open as he went\r\naway, and watched him go to his room and close the door.  As I stood\r\nwithout moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the\r\npassage, she had her back to me, so did not see me, and go into the\r\nroom where Lucy lay.  The sight touched me.  Devotion is so rare, and\r\nwe are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love.  Here\r\nwas a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of\r\ndeath to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so\r\nthat the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van\r\nHelsing waked me by coming into my room.  He came over to my bedside\r\nand said, "You need not trouble about the knives.  We shall not do\r\nit."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Why not?" I asked.  For his solemnity of the night before had\r\ngreatly impressed me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Because," he said sternly, "it is too late, or too early.  See!"\r\nHere he held up the little golden crucifix.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"This was stolen in the night."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How stolen," I asked in wonder, "since you have it now?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from\r\nthe woman who robbed the dead and the living.  Her punishment will\r\nsurely come, but not through me.  She knew not altogether what she\r\ndid, and thus unknowing, she only stole.  Now we must wait."  He went\r\naway on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a new\r\npuzzle to grapple with.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came, Mr.\r\nMarquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand &amp; Lidderdale.  He was very\r\ngenial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our\r\nhands all cares as to details.  During lunch he told us that Mrs.\r\nWestenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart, and\r\nhad put her affairs in absolute order.  He informed us that, with the\r\nexception of a certain entailed property of Lucy''s father which now,\r\nin default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the\r\nfamily, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to\r\nArthur Holmwood.  When he had told us so much he went on,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition,\r\nand pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter\r\neither penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a\r\nmatrimonial alliance.  Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we\r\nalmost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not\r\nprepared to carry out her wishes.  Of course, we had then no\r\nalternative but to accept.  We were right in principle, and\r\nninety-nine times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic\r\nof events, the accuracy of our judgment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of\r\ndisposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her\r\nwishes.  For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have\r\ncome into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived\r\nher mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no\r\nwill, and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case, have\r\nbeen treated at her decease as under intestacy.  In which case Lord\r\nGodalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the\r\nworld.  And the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to\r\nabandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire\r\nstranger.  I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result,\r\nperfectly rejoiced."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part, in\r\nwhich he was officially interested, of so great a tragedy, was an\r\nobject-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and\r\nsee Lord Godalming.  His coming, however, had been a certain comfort\r\nto us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile\r\ncriticism as to any of our acts.  Arthur was expected at five o''clock,\r\nso a little before that time we visited the death chamber.  It was so\r\nin very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it.  The\r\nundertaker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could of\r\nhis goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered\r\nour spirits at once.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,\r\nexplaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be\r\nless harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiancee\r\nquite alone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself\r\nto restore things to the condition in which we left them the night\r\nbefore, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we\r\ncould avoid were saved.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPoor fellow!  He looked desperately sad and broken.  Even his stalwart\r\nmanhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his\r\nmuch-tried emotions.  He had, I knew, been very genuinely and\r\ndevotedly attached to his father, and to lose him, and at such a time,\r\nwas a bitter blow to him.  With me he was warm as ever, and to Van\r\nHelsing he was sweetly courteous.  But I could not help seeing that\r\nthere was some constraint with him.  The professor noticed it too, and\r\nmotioned me to bring him upstairs.  I did so, and left him at the door\r\nof the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but\r\nhe took my arm and led me in, saying huskily,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You loved her too, old fellow.  She told me all about it, and there\r\nwas no friend had a closer place in her heart than you.  I don''t know\r\nhow to thank you for all you have done for her.  I can''t think\r\nyet&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and\r\nlaid his head on my breast, crying, "Oh, Jack!  Jack!  What shall I\r\ndo?  The whole of life seems gone from me all at once, and there is\r\nnothing in the wide world for me to live for."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI comforted him as well as I could.  In such cases men do not need\r\nmuch expression.  A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over\r\nthe shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a\r\nman''s heart.  I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and\r\nthen I said softly to him, "Come and look at her."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTogether we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her\r\nface.  God!  How beautiful she was.  Every hour seemed to be enhancing\r\nher loveliness.  It frightened and amazed me somewhat.  And as for\r\nArthur, he fell to trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as\r\nwith an ague.  At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint\r\nwhisper, "Jack, is she really dead?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest, for I felt\r\nthat such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer\r\nthan I could help, that it often happened that after death faces\r\nbecome softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty, that\r\nthis was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or\r\nprolonged suffering.  I seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and\r\nafter kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her\r\nlovingly and long, he turned aside.  I told him that that must be\r\ngoodbye, as the coffin had to be prepared, so he went back and took\r\nher dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her\r\nforehead.  He came away, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her\r\nas he came.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI left him in the drawing room, and told Van Helsing that he had said\r\ngoodbye, so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker''s\r\nmen to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin.  When\r\nhe came out of the room again I told him of Arthur''s question, and he\r\nreplied, "I am not surprised.  Just now I doubted for a moment\r\nmyself!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to\r\nmake the best of things.  Van Helsing had been silent all dinner time,\r\nbut when we had lit our cigars he said, "Lord&#8230;" but Arthur\r\ninterrupted him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No, no, not that, for God''s sake!  Not yet at any rate.  Forgive me,\r\nsir.  I did not mean to speak offensively.  It is only because my loss\r\nis so recent."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor answered very sweetly, "I only used that name because I\r\nwas in doubt.  I must not call you ''Mr.'' and I have grown to love you,\r\nyes, my dear boy, to love you, as Arthur."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur held out his hand, and took the old man''s warmly.  "Call me\r\nwhat you will," he said.  "I hope I may always have the title of a\r\nfriend.  And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for\r\nyour goodness to my poor dear."  He paused a moment, and went on, "I\r\nknow that she understood your goodness even better than I do.  And if\r\nI was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so, you\r\nremember"--the Professor nodded--"you must forgive me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe answered with a grave kindness, "I know it was hard for you to\r\nquite trust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand,\r\nand I take it that you do not, that you cannot, trust me now, for you\r\ndo not yet understand.  And there may be more times when I shall want\r\nyou to trust when you cannot, and may not, and must not yet\r\nunderstand.  But the time will come when your trust shall be whole and\r\ncomplete in me, and when you shall understand as though the sunlight\r\nhimself shone through.  Then you shall bless me from first to last for\r\nyour own sake, and for the sake of others, and for her dear sake to\r\nwhom I swore to protect."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And indeed, indeed, sir," said Arthur warmly.  "I shall in all ways\r\ntrust you.  I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you\r\nare Jack''s friend, and you were hers.  You shall do what you like."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to\r\nspeak, and finally said, "May I ask you something now?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Certainly."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No, poor dear.  I never thought of it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will.\r\nI want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy''s papers and\r\nletters.  Believe me, it is no idle curiosity.  I have a motive of\r\nwhich, be sure, she would have approved.  I have them all here.  I\r\ntook them before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand\r\nmight touch them, no strange eye look through words into her soul.  I\r\nshall keep them, if I may.  Even you may not see them yet, but I shall\r\nkeep them safe.  No word shall be lost, and in the good time I shall\r\ngive them back to you.  It is a hard thing that I ask, but you will do\r\nit, will you not, for Lucy''s sake?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur spoke out heartily, like his old self, "Dr. Van Helsing, you\r\nmay do what you will.  I feel that in saying this I am doing what my\r\ndear one would have approved.  I shall not trouble you with questions\r\ntill the time comes."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe old Professor stood up as he said solemnly, "And you are right.\r\nThere will be pain for us all, but it will not be all pain, nor will\r\nthis pain be the last.  We and you too, you most of all, dear boy,\r\nwill have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet.\r\nBut we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our duty, and all\r\nwill be well!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI slept on a sofa in Arthur''s room that night.  Van Helsing did not go\r\nto bed at all.  He went to and fro, as if patroling the house, and was\r\nnever out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn\r\nwith the wild garlic flowers, which sent through the odour of lily and\r\nrose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n22 September.--In the train to Exeter.  Jonathan sleeping.  It seems\r\nonly yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between\r\nthen, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and no news\r\nof him, and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner,\r\nrich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and\r\nJonathan with another attack that may harm him.  Some day he may ask\r\nme about it.  Down it all goes.  I am rusty in my shorthand, see what\r\nunexpected prosperity does for us, so it may be as well to freshen it\r\nup again with an exercise anyhow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe service was very simple and very solemn.  There were only\r\nourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from\r\nExeter, his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John\r\nPaxton, the President of the Incorporated Law Society.  Jonathan and I\r\nstood hand in hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was\r\ngone from us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe came back to town quietly, taking a bus to Hyde Park Corner.\r\nJonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while,\r\nso we sat down.  But there were very few people there, and it was\r\nsad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs.  It made us\r\nthink of the empty chair at home.  So we got up and walked down\r\nPiccadilly.  Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in\r\nthe old days before I went to school.  I felt it very improper, for\r\nyou can''t go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other\r\ngirls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit.  But it\r\nwas Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn''t know anybody who\r\nsaw us, and we didn''t care if they did, so on we walked.  I was\r\nlooking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in\r\na victoria outside Guiliano''s, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so\r\ntight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath, "My God!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit\r\nmay upset him again.  So I turned to him quickly, and asked him what\r\nit was that disturbed him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror\r\nand half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose\r\nand black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the\r\npretty girl.  He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either\r\nof us, and so I had a good view of him.  His face was not a good\r\nface.  It was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and big white teeth, that\r\nlooked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like\r\nan animal''s.  Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would\r\nnotice.  I feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty.\r\nI asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently\r\nthinking that I knew as much about it as he did, "Do you see who it\r\nis?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No, dear," I said.  "I don''t know him, who is it?"  His answer seemed\r\nto shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it\r\nwas me, Mina, to whom he was speaking.  "It is the man himself!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe poor dear was evidently terrified at something, very greatly\r\nterrified.  I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to\r\nsupport him he would have sunk down.  He kept staring.  A man came out\r\nof the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then\r\ndrove off.  The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the\r\ncarriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and\r\nhailed a hansom.  Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to\r\nhimself,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young.  My God, if this\r\nbe so!  Oh, my God!  My God!  If only I knew!  If only I knew!"  He was\r\ndistressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the\r\nsubject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent.  I drew\r\naway quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily.  We walked a little\r\nfurther, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park.  It\r\nwas a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady\r\nplace.  After a few minutes'' staring at nothing, Jonathan''s eyes\r\nclosed, and he went quickly into a sleep, with his head on my\r\nshoulder.  I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb\r\nhim.  In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite\r\ncheerfully,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Why, Mina, have I been asleep!  Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.\r\nCome, and we''ll have a cup of tea somewhere."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger, as in his\r\nillness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of.  I\r\ndon''t like this lapsing into forgetfulness.  It may make or continue\r\nsome injury to the brain.  I must not ask him, for fear I shall do\r\nmore harm than good, but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey\r\nabroad.  The time is come, I fear, when I must open the parcel, and\r\nknow what is written.  Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I\r\ndo wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--A sad homecoming in every way, the house empty of the dear\r\nsoul who was so good to us.  Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a\r\nslight relapse of his malady, and now a telegram from Van Helsing,\r\nwhoever he may be.  "You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra\r\ndied five days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday.  They\r\nwere both buried today."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words!  Poor Mrs. Westenra!  Poor\r\nLucy!  Gone, gone, never to return to us!  And poor, poor Arthur, to\r\nhave lost such a sweetness out of his life!  God help us all to bear\r\nour troubles.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY-CONT.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n22 September.--It is all over.  Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has\r\ntaken Quincey Morris with him.  What a fine fellow is Quincey!  I\r\nbelieve in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy''s\r\ndeath as any of us, but he bore himself through it like a moral\r\nViking.  If America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a\r\npower in the world indeed.  Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest\r\npreparatory to his journey.  He goes to Amsterdam tonight, but says he\r\nreturns tomorrow night, that he only wants to make some arrangements\r\nwhich can only be made personally.  He is to stop with me then, if he\r\ncan.  He says he has work to do in London which may take him some\r\ntime.  Poor old fellow!  I fear that the strain of the past week has\r\nbroken down even his iron strength.  All the time of the burial he\r\nwas, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself.  When it\r\nwas all over, we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was\r\nspeaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been\r\ntransfused to his Lucy''s veins.  I could see Van Helsing''s face grow\r\nwhite and purple by turns.  Arthur was saying that he felt since then\r\nas if they two had been really married, and that she was his wife in\r\nthe sight of God.  None of us said a word of the other operations, and\r\nnone of us ever shall.  Arthur and Quincey went away together to the\r\nstation, and Van Helsing and I came on here.  The moment we were alone\r\nin the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics.  He has\r\ndenied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it was\r\nonly his sense of humor asserting itself under very terrible\r\nconditions.  He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the\r\nblinds lest any one should see us and misjudge.  And then he cried,\r\ntill he laughed again, and laughed and cried together, just as a woman\r\ndoes.  I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the\r\ncircumstances, but it had no effect.  Men and women are so different\r\nin manifestations of nervous strength or weakness!  Then when his face\r\ngrew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such\r\na time.  His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was\r\nlogical and forceful and mysterious.  He said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Ah, you don''t comprehend, friend John.  Do not think that I am not\r\nsad, though I laugh.  See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke\r\nme.  But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh\r\nhe come just the same.  Keep it always with you that laughter who\r\nknock at your door and say, ''May I come in?'' is not true laughter.\r\nNo!  He is a king, and he come when and how he like.  He ask no\r\nperson, he choose no time of suitability.  He say, ''I am here.''\r\nBehold, in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young\r\ngirl.  I give my blood for her, though I am old and worn.  I give my\r\ntime, my skill, my sleep.  I let my other sufferers want that she may\r\nhave all.  And yet I can laugh at her very grave, laugh when the clay\r\nfrom the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say ''Thud,\r\nthud!'' to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek.  My\r\nheart bleed for that poor boy, that dear boy, so of the age of mine\r\nown boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes\r\nthe same.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There, you know now why I love him so.  And yet when he say things\r\nthat touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart\r\nyearn to him as to no other man, not even you, friend John, for we are\r\nmore level in experiences than father and son, yet even at such a\r\nmoment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear, ''Here I\r\nam!  Here I am!'' till the blood come dance back and bring some of the\r\nsunshine that he carry with him to my cheek.  Oh, friend John, it is a\r\nstrange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and\r\ntroubles.  And yet when King Laugh come, he make them all dance to the\r\ntune he play.  Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and\r\ntears that burn as they fall, all dance together to the music that he\r\nmake with that smileless mouth of him.  And believe me, friend John,\r\nthat he is good to come, and kind.  Ah, we men and women are like\r\nropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways.  Then tears\r\ncome, and like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps\r\nthe strain become too great, and we break.  But King Laugh he come\r\nlike the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again, and we bear to go\r\non with our labor, what it may be."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea, but as\r\nI did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him.  As\r\nhe answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different\r\ntone,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, it was the grim irony of it all, this so lovely lady garlanded\r\nwith flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered\r\nif she were truly dead, she laid in that so fine marble house in that\r\nlonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the\r\nmother who loved her, and whom she loved, and that sacred bell going\r\n''Toll!  Toll!  Toll!'' so sad and slow, and those holy men, with the\r\nwhite garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the\r\ntime their eyes never on the page, and all of us with the bowed head.\r\nAnd all for what?  She is dead, so!  Is it not?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, for the life of me, Professor," I said, "I can''t see anything\r\nto laugh at in all that.  Why, your expression makes it a harder\r\npuzzle than before.  But even if the burial service was comic, what\r\nabout poor Art and his trouble?  Why his heart was simply breaking."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Just so.  Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins\r\nhad made her truly his bride?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Quite so.  But there was a difficulty, friend John.  If so that, then\r\nwhat about the others?  Ho, ho!  Then this so sweet maid is a\r\npolyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by\r\nChurch''s law, though no wits, all gone, even I, who am faithful\r\nhusband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I don''t see where the joke comes in there either!" I said, and I did\r\nnot feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things.  He\r\nlaid his hand on my arm, and said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Friend John, forgive me if I pain.  I showed not my feeling to others\r\nwhen it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.\r\nIf you could have looked into my heart then when I want to laugh, if\r\nyou could have done so when the laugh arrived, if you could do so now,\r\nwhen King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him, for he\r\ngo far, far away from me, and for a long, long time, maybe you would\r\nperhaps pity me the most of all."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Because I know!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd now we are all scattered, and for many a long day loneliness will\r\nsit over our roofs with brooding wings.  Lucy lies in the tomb of her\r\nkin, a lordly death house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming\r\nLondon, where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,\r\nand where wild flowers grow of their own accord.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo I can finish this diary, and God only knows if I shall ever begin\r\nanother.  If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal\r\nwith different people and different themes, for here at the end, where\r\nthe romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of\r\nmy life-work, I say sadly and without hope, "FINIS".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTHE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe neighborhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised\r\nwith a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel\r\nto those of what was known to the writers of headlines as\r\n"The Kensington Horror," or "The Stabbing Woman," or "The\r\nWoman in Black."  During the past two or three days several\r\ncases have occurred of young children straying from home or\r\nneglecting to return from their playing on the Heath.  In\r\nall these cases the children were too young to give any\r\nproperly intelligible account of themselves, but the\r\nconsensus of their excuses is that they had been with a\r\n"bloofer lady."  It has always been late in the evening when\r\nthey have been missed, and on two occasions the children\r\nhave not been found until early in the following morning.\r\nIt is generally supposed in the neighborhood that, as the\r\nfirst child missed gave as his reason for being away that a\r\n"bloofer lady" had asked him to come for a walk, the others\r\nhad picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served.  This\r\nis the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones\r\nat present is luring each other away by wiles.  A correspondent\r\nwrites us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the\r\n"bloofer lady" is supremely funny.  Some of our caricaturists\r\nmight, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by\r\ncomparing the reality and the picture.  It is only in accordance\r\nwith general principles of human nature that the "bloofer lady"\r\nshould be the popular role at these al fresco performances.  Our\r\ncorrespondent naively says that even Ellen Terry could not be so\r\nwinningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little\r\nchildren pretend, and even imagine themselves, to be.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere is, however, possibly a serious side to the question,\r\nfor some of the children, indeed all who have been missed\r\nat night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat.\r\nThe wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small\r\ndog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend\r\nto show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method\r\nof its own.  The police of the division have been instructed to\r\nkeep a sharp lookout for straying children, especially when very\r\nyoung, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog which\r\nmay be about.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTHE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER EXTRA SPECIAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTHE HAMPSTEAD HORROR\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nANOTHER CHILD INJURED\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTHE "BLOOFER LADY"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe have just received intelligence that another child,\r\nmissed last night, was only discovered late in the morning\r\nunder a furze bush at the Shooter''s Hill side of Hampstead\r\nHeath, which is perhaps, less frequented than the other\r\nparts.  It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has\r\nbeen noticed in other cases.  It was terribly weak, and\r\nlooked quite emaciated.  It too, when partially restored,\r\nhad the common story to tell of being lured away by the\r\n"bloofer lady".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

I am so glad\r\nthat he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the\r\nterrible things, and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down\r\nwith the responsibility of his new position.  I knew he would be true\r\nto himself, and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the\r\nheight of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties\r\nthat come upon him.  He will be away all day till late, for he said he\r\ncould not lunch at home.  My household work is done, so I shall take\r\nhis foreign journal, and lock myself up in my room and read it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n24 September.--I hadn''t the heart to write last night, that terrible\r\nrecord of Jonathan''s upset me so.  Poor dear!  How he must have\r\nsuffered, whether it be true or only imagination.  I wonder if there\r\nis any truth in it at all.  Did he get his brain fever, and then write\r\nall those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?  I suppose\r\nI shall never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.  And yet\r\nthat man we saw yesterday!  He seemed quite certain of him, poor\r\nfellow!  I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back\r\non some train of thought.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe believes it all himself.  I remember how on our wedding day he said\r\n"Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours,\r\nasleep or awake, mad or sane&#8230;"  There seems to be through it all\r\nsome thread of continuity.  That fearful Count was coming to London.\r\nIf it should be, and he came to London, with its teeming millions&#8230;\r\nThere may be a solemn duty, and if it come we must not shrink from\r\nit.  I shall be prepared.  I shall get my typewriter this very hour\r\nand begin transcribing.  Then we shall be ready for other eyes if\r\nrequired.  And if it be wanted, then, perhaps, if I am ready, poor\r\nJonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let him\r\nbe troubled or worried with it at all.  If ever Jonathan quite gets\r\nover the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask\r\nhim questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, VAN HELSING TO MRS.

In them\r\nI find some letters from you, which show how great friends\r\nyou were and how you love her.  Oh, Madam Mina, by that\r\nlove, I implore you, help me.  It is for others'' good that\r\nI ask, to redress great wrong, and to lift much and terrible\r\ntroubles, that may be more great than you can know.  May it be\r\nthat I see you?  You can trust me.  I am friend of Dr. John\r\nSeward and of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy).  I\r\nmust keep it private for the present from all.  I should come to\r\nExeter to see you at once if you tell me I am privilege to come,\r\nand where and when.  I implore your pardon, Madam.  I have read\r\nyour letters to poor Lucy, and know how good you are and how your\r\nhusband suffer.  So I pray you, if it may be, enlighten him not,\r\nleast it may harm.  Again your pardon, and forgive me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"VAN HELSING"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTELEGRAM, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n25 September.--Come today by quarter past ten train if you\r\ncan catch it.  Can see you any time you call.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"WILHELMINA HARKER"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n25 September.--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time\r\ndraws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that\r\nit will throw some light upon Jonathan''s sad experience, and as he\r\nattended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about\r\nher.  That is the reason of his coming.  It is concerning Lucy and her\r\nsleep-walking, and not about Jonathan.  Then I shall never know the\r\nreal truth now!  How silly I am.  That awful journal gets hold of my\r\nimagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour.  Of\r\ncourse it is about Lucy.  That habit came back to the poor dear, and\r\nthat awful night on the cliff must have made her ill.  I had almost\r\nforgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards.  She must have\r\ntold him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew\r\nall about it, and now he wants me to tell him what I know, so that he\r\nmay understand.  I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to\r\nMrs. Westenra.  I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were\r\nit even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy.  I hope too,\r\nDr. Van Helsing will not blame me.  I have had so much trouble and\r\nanxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI suppose a cry does us all good at times, clears the air as other\r\nrain does.  Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset\r\nme, and then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a\r\nwhole day and night, the first time we have been parted since our\r\nmarriage.  I do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and\r\nthat nothing will occur to upset him.  It is two o''clock, and the\r\ndoctor will be here soon now.  I shall say nothing of Jonathan''s\r\njournal unless he asks me.  I am so glad I have typewritten out my own\r\njournal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him.\r\nIt will save much questioning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--He has come and gone.  Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it\r\nall makes my head whirl round.  I feel like one in a dream.  Can it be\r\nall possible, or even a part of it?  If I had not read Jonathan''s\r\njournal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility.  Poor,\r\npoor, dear Jonathan!  How he must have suffered.  Please the good God,\r\nall this may not upset him again.  I shall try to save him from it.\r\nBut it may be even a consolation and a help to him, terrible though it\r\nbe and awful in its consequences, to know for certain that his eyes\r\nand ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true.  It\r\nmay be that it is the doubt which haunts him, that when the doubt is\r\nremoved, no matter which, waking or dreaming, may prove the truth, he\r\nwill be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock.  Dr. Van\r\nHelsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur''s\r\nfriend and Dr. Seward''s, and if they brought him all the way from\r\nHolland to look after Lucy.  I feel from having seen him that he is\r\ngood and kind and of a noble nature.  When he comes tomorrow I shall\r\nask him about Jonathan.  And then, please God, all this sorrow and\r\nanxiety may lead to a good end.  I used to think I would like to\r\npractice interviewing.  Jonathan''s friend on "The Exeter News" told\r\nhim that memory is everything in such work, that you must be able to\r\nput down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to refine\r\nsome of it afterwards.  Here was a rare interview.  I shall try to\r\nrecord it verbatim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was half-past two o''clock when the knock came.  I took my courage a\r\ndeux mains and waited.  In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and\r\nannounced "Dr. Van Helsing".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI rose and bowed, and he came towards me, a man of medium weight,\r\nstrongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest\r\nand a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck.  The\r\npoise of the head strikes me at once as indicative of thought and\r\npower.  The head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the\r\nears.  The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large\r\nresolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with\r\nquick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big bushy brows\r\ncome down and the mouth tightens.  The forehead is broad and fine,\r\nrising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps\r\nor ridges wide apart, such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot\r\npossibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides.\r\nBig, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or\r\nstern with the man''s moods.  He said to me,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Mrs. Harker, is it not?"  I bowed assent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That was Miss Mina Murray?"  Again I assented.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear\r\nchild Lucy Westenra.  Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead that I\r\ncome."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Sir," I said, "you could have no better claim on me than that you\r\nwere a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra."  And I held out my hand.\r\nHe took it and said tenderly,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Madam Mina, I know that the friend of that poor little girl must\r\nbe good, but I had yet to learn&#8230;"  He finished his speech with a\r\ncourtly bow.  I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about,\r\nso he at once began.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I have read your letters to Miss Lucy.  Forgive me, but I had to\r\nbegin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask.  I know that\r\nyou were with her at Whitby.  She sometimes kept a diary, you need not\r\nlook surprised, Madam Mina.  It was begun after you had left, and was\r\nan imitation of you, and in that diary she traces by inference certain\r\nthings to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her.\r\nIn great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so\r\nmuch kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details?  It is not\r\nalways so with young ladies."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time.  I can show it to\r\nyou if you like."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Madam Mina, I well be grateful.  You will do me much favour."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit, I suppose\r\nit is some taste of the original apple that remains still in our\r\nmouths, so I handed him the shorthand diary.  He took it with a\r\ngrateful bow, and said, "May I read it?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"If you wish," I answered as demurely as I could.  He opened it, and\r\nfor an instant his face fell.  Then he stood up and bowed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, you so clever woman!" he said.  "I knew long that Mr. Jonathan\r\nwas a man of much thankfulness, but see, his wife have all the good\r\nthings.  And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read\r\nit for me?  Alas!  I know not the shorthand."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed.  So I\r\ntook the typewritten copy from my work basket and handed it to him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Forgive me," I said.  "I could not help it, but I had been thinking\r\nthat it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might\r\nnot have time to wait, not on my account, but because I know your time\r\nmust be precious, I have written it out on the typewriter for you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe took it and his eyes glistened.  "You are so good," he said.  "And\r\nmay I read it now?  I may want to ask you some things when I have\r\nread."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"By all means," I said, "read it over whilst I order lunch, and then\r\nyou can ask me questions whilst we eat."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light,\r\nand became so absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see after lunch\r\nchiefly in order that he might not be disturbed.  When I came back, I\r\nfound him walking hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze\r\nwith excitement.  He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "how can I say what I owe to you?  This\r\npaper is as sunshine.  It opens the gate to me.  I am dazed, I am\r\ndazzled, with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light\r\nevery time.  But that you do not, cannot comprehend.  Oh, but I am\r\ngrateful to you, you so clever woman.  Madame," he said this very\r\nsolemnly, "if ever Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or\r\nyours, I trust you will let me know.  It will be pleasure and delight\r\nif I may serve you as a friend, as a friend, but all I have ever\r\nlearned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love.  There\r\nare darknesses in life, and there are lights.  You are one of the\r\nlights.  You will have a happy life and a good life, and your husband\r\nwill be blessed in you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But, doctor, you praise me too much, and you do not know me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Not know you, I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and\r\nwomen, I who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to\r\nhim and all that follow from him!  And I have read your diary that you\r\nhave so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every\r\nline.  I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your\r\nmarriage and your trust, not know you!  Oh, Madam Mina, good women\r\ntell all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such\r\nthings that angels can read.  And we men who wish to know have in us\r\nsomething of angels'' eyes.  Your husband is noble nature, and you are\r\nnoble too, for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean\r\nnature.  And your husband, tell me of him.  Is he quite well?  Is all\r\nthat fever gone, and is he strong and hearty?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I said, "He was\r\nalmost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins death."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe interrupted, "Oh, yes.  I know.  I know.  I have read your last two\r\nletters."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went on, "I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on\r\nThursday last he had a sort of shock."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"A shock, and after brain fever so soon!  That is not good.  What kind\r\nof shock was it?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something\r\nwhich led to his brain fever."  And here the whole thing seemed to\r\noverwhelm me in a rush.  The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he\r\nexperienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that\r\nhas been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult.  I suppose\r\nI was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands\r\nto him, and implored him to make my husband well again.  He took my\r\nhands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me.  He\r\nheld my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have\r\nnot had much time for friendships, but since I have been summoned to\r\nhere by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and\r\nseen such nobility that I feel more than ever, and it has grown with\r\nmy advancing years, the loneliness of my life.  Believe me, then, that\r\nI come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope, hope,\r\nnot in what I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left\r\nto make life happy, good women, whose lives and whose truths may make\r\ngood lesson for the children that are to be.  I am glad, glad, that I\r\nmay here be of some use to you.  For if your husband suffer, he suffer\r\nwithin the range of my study and experience.  I promise you that I\r\nwill gladly do all for him that I can, all to make his life strong and\r\nmanly, and your life a happy one.  Now you must eat.  You are\r\noverwrought and perhaps over-anxious.  Husband Jonathan would not like\r\nto see you so pale, and what he like not where he love, is not to his\r\ngood.  Therefore for his sake you must eat and smile.  You have told\r\nme about Lucy, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress.\r\nI shall stay in Exeter tonight, for I want to think much over what you\r\nhave told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if I\r\nmay.  And then too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan''s trouble so\r\nfar as you can, but not yet.  You must eat now, afterwards you shall\r\ntell me all."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter lunch, when we went back to the drawing room, he said to me,\r\n"And now tell me all about him."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen it came to speaking to this great learned man, I began to fear\r\nthat he would think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman, that\r\njournal is all so strange, and I hesitated to go on.  But he was so\r\nsweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I trusted him, so I\r\nsaid,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must\r\nnot laugh at me or at my husband.  I have been since yesterday in a\r\nsort of fever of doubt.  You must be kind to me, and not think me\r\nfoolish that I have even half believed some very strange things."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said, "Oh,\r\nmy dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I\r\nam here, it is you who would laugh.  I have learned not to think\r\nlittle of any one''s belief, no matter how strange it may be.  I have\r\ntried to keep an open mind, and it is not the ordinary things of life\r\nthat could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things,\r\nthe things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Thank you, thank you a thousand times!  You have taken a weight off my\r\nmind.  If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read.  It is\r\nlong, but I have typewritten it out.  It will tell you my trouble and\r\nJonathan''s.  It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that\r\nhappened.  I dare not say anything of it.  You will read for yourself\r\nand judge.  And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind\r\nand tell me what you think."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I promise," he said as I gave him the papers.  "I shall in the\r\nmorning, as soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I\r\nmay."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch\r\nwith us and see him then.  You could catch the quick 3:34 train, which\r\nwill leave you at Paddington before eight."  He was surprised at my\r\nknowledge of the trains offhand, but he does not know that I have made\r\nup all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in\r\ncase he is in a hurry.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here thinking,\r\nthinking I don''t know what.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER (by hand), VAN HELSING TO MRS.

Strange and terrible as it is, it is\r\ntrue!  I will pledge my life on it.  It may be worse for\r\nothers, but for him and you there is no dread.  He is a\r\nnoble fellow, and let me tell you from experience of men,\r\nthat one who would do as he did in going down that wall and\r\nto that room, aye, and going a second time, is not one to\r\nbe injured in permanence by a shock.  His brain and his\r\nheart are all right, this I swear, before I have even seen\r\nhim, so be at rest.  I shall have much to ask him of other\r\nthings.  I am blessed that today I come to see you, for I\r\nhave learn all at once so much that again I am dazzled,\r\ndazzled more than ever, and I must think.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yours the most faithful,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Abraham Van Helsing."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, MRS.

And yet, if it be true, what\r\nterrible things there are in the world, and what an awful\r\nthing if that man, that monster, be really in London!  I\r\nfear to think.  I have this moment, whilst writing, had a\r\nwire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 tonight\r\nfrom Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have\r\nno fear tonight.  Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with\r\nus, please come to breakfast at eight o''clock, if this be not too\r\nearly for you?  You can get away, if you are in a hurry, by the\r\n10:30 train, which will bring you to Paddington by 2:35.  Do not\r\nanswer this, as I shall take it that, if I do not hear, you will\r\ncome to breakfast.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Believe me,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Your faithful and grateful friend,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Mina Harker."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n26 September.--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the\r\ntime has come.  When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and\r\nwhen we had supped she told me of Van Helsing''s visit, and of her\r\nhaving given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she\r\nhas been about me.  She showed me in the doctor''s letter that all I\r\nwrote down was true.  It seems to have made a new man of me.  It was\r\nthe doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over.\r\nI felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful.  But, now that I\r\nknow, I am not afraid, even of the Count.  He has succeeded after all,\r\nthen, in his design in getting to London, and it was he I saw.  He has\r\ngot younger, and how?  Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt\r\nhim out, if he is anything like what Mina says.  We sat late, and\r\ntalked it over.  Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a\r\nfew minutes and bring him over.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was, I think, surprised to see me.  When I came into the room where\r\nhe was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned\r\nmy face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was so funny to hear my wife called ''Madam Mina'' by this kindly,\r\nstrong-faced old man.  I smiled, and said, "I was ill, I have had a\r\nshock, but you have cured me already."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And how?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"By your letter to Mina last night.  I was in doubt, and then\r\neverything took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust,\r\neven the evidence of my own senses.  Not knowing what to trust, I did\r\nnot know what to do, and so had only to keep on working in what had\r\nhitherto been the groove of my life.  The groove ceased to avail me,\r\nand I mistrusted myself.  Doctor, you don''t know what it is to doubt\r\neverything, even yourself.  No, you don''t, you couldn''t with eyebrows\r\nlike yours."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, "So!  You are a\r\nphysiognomist.  I learn more here with each hour.  I am with so much\r\npleasure coming to you to breakfast, and, oh, sir, you will pardon\r\npraise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply\r\nnodded and stood silent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"She is one of God''s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men\r\nand other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that\r\nits light can be here on earth.  So true, so sweet, so noble, so\r\nlittle an egoist, and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so\r\nsceptical and selfish.  And you, sir&#8230; I have read all the letters\r\nto poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, so I know you since\r\nsome days from the knowing of others, but I have seen your true self\r\nsince last night.  You will give me your hand, will you not?  And let\r\nus be friends for all our lives."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me\r\nquite choky.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And now," he said, "may I ask you for some more help?  I have a great\r\ntask to do, and at the beginning it is to know.  You can help me\r\nhere.  Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania?\r\nLater on I may ask more help, and of a different kind, but at first\r\nthis will do."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Look here, Sir," I said, "does what you have to do concern the\r\nCount?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It does," he said solemnly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then I am with you heart and soul.  As you go by the 10:30 train, you\r\nwill not have time to read them, but I shall get the bundle of papers.\r\nYou can take them with you and read them in the train."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter breakfast I saw him to the station.  When we were parting he\r\nsaid, "Perhaps you will come to town if I send for you, and take Madam\r\nMina too."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We shall both come when you will," I said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous\r\nnight, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for\r\nthe train to start, he was turning them over.  His eyes suddenly\r\nseemed to catch something in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette", I\r\nknew it by the colour, and he grew quite white.  He read something\r\nintently, groaning to himself, "Mein Gott!  Mein Gott!  So soon!  So\r\nsoon!"  I do not think he remembered me at the moment.  Just then the\r\nwhistle blew, and the train moved off.  This recalled him to himself,\r\nand he leaned out of the window and waved his hand, calling out, "Love\r\nto Madam Mina.  I shall write so soon as ever I can."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n26 September.--Truly there is no such thing as finality.  Not a week\r\nsince I said "Finis," and yet here I am starting fresh again, or\r\nrather going on with the record.  Until this afternoon I had no cause\r\nto think of what is done.  Renfield had become, to all intents, as\r\nsane as he ever was.  He was already well ahead with his fly business,\r\nand he had just started in the spider line also, so he had not been of\r\nany trouble to me.  I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and\r\nfrom it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well.  Quincey\r\nMorris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a\r\nbubbling well of good spirits.  Quincey wrote me a line too, and from\r\nhim I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old\r\nbuoyancy, so as to them all my mind is at rest.  As for myself, I was\r\nsettling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for\r\nit, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy\r\nleft on me was becoming cicatrised.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEverything is, however, now reopened, and what is to be the end God\r\nonly knows.  I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but\r\nhe will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity.  He went to\r\nExeter yesterday, and stayed there all night.  Today he came back, and\r\nalmost bounded into the room at about half-past five o''clock, and\r\nthrust last night''s "Westminster Gazette" into my hand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What do you think of that?" he asked as he stood back and folded his\r\narms.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant, but\r\nhe took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being\r\ndecoyed away at Hampstead.  It did not convey much to me, until I\r\nreached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their\r\nthroats.  An idea struck me, and I looked up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well?" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is like poor Lucy''s."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And what do you make of it?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Simply that there is some cause in common.  Whatever it was that\r\ninjured her has injured them."  I did not quite understand his answer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That is true indirectly, but not directly."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How do you mean, Professor?" I asked.  I was a little inclined to\r\ntake his seriousness lightly, for, after all, four days of rest and\r\nfreedom from burning, harrowing, anxiety does help to restore one''s\r\nspirits, but when I saw his face, it sobered me.  Never, even in the\r\nmidst of our despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Tell me!" I said.  "I can hazard no opinion.  I do not know what to\r\nthink, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to\r\nwhat poor Lucy died of, not after all the hints given, not only by\r\nevents, but by me?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Of nervous prostration following a great loss or waste of blood."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And how was the blood lost or wasted?"  I shook my head.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on, "You are a clever\r\nman, friend John.  You reason well, and your wit is bold, but you are\r\ntoo prejudiced.  You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and\r\nthat which is outside your daily life is not of account to you.  Do\r\nyou not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and\r\nyet which are, that some people see things that others cannot?  But\r\nthere are things old and new which must not be contemplated by men''s\r\neyes, because they know, or think they know, some things which other\r\nmen have told them.  Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants\r\nto explain all, and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing\r\nto explain.  But yet we see around us every day the growth of new\r\nbeliefs, which think themselves new, and which are yet but the old,\r\nwhich pretend to be young, like the fine ladies at the opera.  I\r\nsuppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference.  No?  Nor in\r\nmaterialization.  No?  Nor in astral bodies.  No?  Nor in the reading\r\nof thought.  No?  Nor in hypnotism&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes," I said.  "Charcot has proved that pretty well."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe smiled as he went on, "Then you are satisfied as to it.  Yes?  And\r\nof course then you understand how it act, and can follow the mind of\r\nthe great Charcot, alas that he is no more, into the very soul of the\r\npatient that he influence.  No?  Then, friend John, am I to take it\r\nthat you simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to\r\nconclusion be a blank?  No?  Then tell me, for I am a student of the\r\nbrain, how you accept hypnotism and reject the thought reading.  Let\r\nme tell you, my friend, that there are things done today in electrical\r\nscience which would have been deemed unholy by the very man who\r\ndiscovered electricity, who would themselves not so long before been\r\nburned as wizards.  There are always mysteries in life.  Why was it\r\nthat Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and ''Old Parr'' one hundred\r\nand sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men''s blood in her\r\npoor veins, could not live even one day?  For, had she live one more\r\nday, we could save her.  Do you know all the mystery of life and\r\ndeath?  Do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say\r\nwherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others?\r\nCan you tell me why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one\r\ngreat spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish\r\nchurch and grew and grew, till, on descending, he could drink the oil\r\nof all the church lamps?  Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and\r\nelsewhere, there are bats that come out at night and open the veins of\r\ncattle and horses and suck dry their veins, how in some islands of the\r\nWestern seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day, and those\r\nwho have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, and that when the\r\nsailors sleep on the deck, because that it is hot, flit down on them\r\nand then, and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even\r\nMiss Lucy was?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good God, Professor!" I said, starting up.  "Do you mean to tell me\r\nthat Lucy was bitten by such a bat, and that such a thing is here in\r\nLondon in the nineteenth century?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe waved his hand for silence, and went on, "Can you tell me why the\r\ntortoise lives more long than generations of men, why the elephant\r\ngoes on and on till he have sees dynasties, and why the parrot never\r\ndie only of bite of cat of dog or other complaint?  Can you tell me\r\nwhy men believe in all ages and places that there are men and women\r\nwho cannot die?  We all know, because science has vouched for the\r\nfact, that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of\r\nyears, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of\r\nthe world.  Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to\r\ndie and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it,\r\nand the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and\r\nthen men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the\r\nIndian fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as\r\nbefore?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere I interrupted him.  I was getting bewildered.  He so crowded on\r\nmy mind his list of nature''s eccentricities and possible\r\nimpossibilities that my imagination was getting fired.  I had a dim\r\nidea that he was teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in\r\nhis study at Amsterdam.  But he used them to tell me the thing, so\r\nthat I could have the object of thought in mind all the time.  But now\r\nI was without his help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Professor, let me be your pet student again.  Tell me the thesis, so\r\nthat I may apply your knowledge as you go on.  At present I am going\r\nin my mind from point to point as a madman, and not a sane one,\r\nfollows an idea.  I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a\r\nmidst, jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to\r\nmove on without knowing where I am going."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That is a good image," he said.  "Well, I shall tell you.  My thesis\r\nis this, I want you to believe."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"To believe what?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"To believe in things that you cannot.  Let me illustrate.  I heard\r\nonce of an American who so defined faith, ''that faculty which enables\r\nus to believe things which we know to be untrue.''  For one, I follow\r\nthat man.  He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a\r\nlittle bit of truth check the rush of the big truth, like a small rock\r\ndoes a railway truck.  We get the small truth first.  Good!  We keep\r\nhim, and we value him, but all the same we must not let him think\r\nhimself all the truth in the universe."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then you want me not to let some previous conviction inure the\r\nreceptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter.  Do I read\r\nyour lesson aright?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Ah, you are my favourite pupil still.  It is worth to teach you.  Now\r\nthat you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to\r\nunderstand.  You think then that those so small holes in the\r\nchildren''s throats were made by the same that made the holes in Miss\r\nLucy?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe stood up and said solemnly, "Then you are wrong.  Oh, would it were\r\nso!  But alas!  No.  It is worse, far, far worse."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"In God''s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?" I cried.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed\r\nhis elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"They were made by Miss Lucy!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

It was as if he had during her\r\nlife struck Lucy on the face.  I smote the table hard and rose up as I\r\nsaid to him, "Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the tenderness of his\r\nface calmed me at once.  "Would I were!" he said.  "Madness were easy\r\nto bear compared with truth like this.  Oh, my friend, why, think\r\nyou, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell so simple a\r\nthing?  Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life?  Was\r\nit because I wished to give you pain?  Was it that I wanted, now so\r\nlate, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful\r\ndeath?  Ah no!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Forgive me," said I.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe went on, "My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the\r\nbreaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady.  But\r\neven yet I do not expect you to believe.  It is so hard to accept at\r\nonce any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we\r\nhave always believed the ''no'' of it.  It is more hard still to accept\r\nso sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy.  Tonight I go\r\nto prove it.  Dare you come with me?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis staggered me.  A man does not like to prove such a truth, Byron\r\nexcepted from the category, jealousy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    "And prove the very truth he most abhorred."<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe saw my hesitation, and spoke, "The logic is simple, no madman''s\r\nlogic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog.  If\r\nit not be true, then proof will be relief.  At worst it will not harm.\r\nIf it be true!  Ah, there is the dread.  Yet every dread should help my\r\ncause, for in it is some need of belief.  Come, I tell you what I\r\npropose.  First, that we go off now and see that child in the\r\nhospital.  Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say\r\nthe child is, is a friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were\r\nin class at Amsterdam.  He will let two scientists see his case, if he\r\nwill not let two friends.  We shall tell him nothing, but only that we\r\nwish to learn.  And then&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And then?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe took a key from his pocket and held it up.  "And then we spend the\r\nnight, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies.  This is the key\r\nthat lock the tomb.  I had it from the coffin man to give to Arthur."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal\r\nbefore us.  I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I\r\ncould and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was\r\npassing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe found the child awake.  It had had a sleep and taken some food, and\r\naltogether was going on well.  Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its\r\nthroat, and showed us the punctures.  There was no mistaking the\r\nsimilarity to those which had been on Lucy''s throat.  They were\r\nsmaller, and the edges looked fresher, that was all.  We asked Vincent\r\nto what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a\r\nbite of some animal, perhaps a rat, but for his own part, he was\r\ninclined to think it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the\r\nnorthern heights of London.  "Out of so many harmless ones," he said,\r\n"there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant\r\nspecies.  Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to\r\nescape, or even from the Zoological Gardens a young one may have got\r\nloose, or one be bred there from a vampire.  These things do occur,\r\nyou, know.  Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe,\r\ntraced up in this direction.  For a week after, the children were\r\nplaying nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in\r\nthe place until this ''bloofer lady'' scare came along, since then it\r\nhas been quite a gala time with them.  Even this poor little mite,\r\nwhen he woke up today, asked the nurse if he might go away.  When she\r\nasked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the\r\n''bloofer lady''."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I hope," said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending the child home\r\nyou will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it.  These\r\nfancies to stray are most dangerous, and if the child were to remain\r\nout another night, it would probably be fatal.  But in any case I\r\nsuppose you will not let it away for some days?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Certainly not, not for a week at least, longer if the wound is not\r\nhealed."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOur visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and\r\nthe sun had dipped before we came out.  When Van Helsing saw how dark\r\nit was, he said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There is not hurry.  It is more late than I thought.  Come, let us\r\nseek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe dined at ''Jack Straw''s Castle'' along with a little crowd of\r\nbicyclists and others who were genially noisy.  About ten o''clock we\r\nstarted from the inn.  It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps\r\nmade the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual\r\nradius.  The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for\r\nhe went on unhesitatingly, but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as\r\nto locality.  As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till\r\nat last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of\r\nhorse police going their usual suburban round.  At last we reached the\r\nwall of the churchyard, which we climbed over.  With some little\r\ndifficulty, for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so\r\nstrange to us, we found the Westenra tomb.  The Professor took the\r\nkey, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite\r\nunconsciously, motioned me to precede him.  There was a delicious\r\nirony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a\r\nghastly occasion.  My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously\r\ndrew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a\r\nfalling, and not a spring one.  In the latter case we should have been\r\nin a bad plight.  Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a\r\nmatchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light.  The tomb\r\nin the daytime, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim\r\nand gruesome enough, but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers\r\nhung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to\r\nbrowns, when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed\r\ndominance, when the time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar,\r\nand rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating\r\ngave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more\r\nmiserable and sordid than could have been imagined.  It conveyed\r\nirresistibly the idea that life, animal life, was not the only thing\r\nwhich could pass away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing went about his work systematically.  Holding his candle so\r\nthat he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm\r\ndropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he\r\nmade assurance of Lucy''s coffin.  Another search in his bag, and he\r\ntook out a turnscrew.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What are you going to do?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"To open the coffin.  You shall yet be convinced."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStraightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the\r\nlid, showing the casing of lead beneath.  The sight was almost too\r\nmuch for me.  It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it\r\nwould have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst\r\nliving.  I actually took hold of his hand to stop him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe only said, "You shall see," and again fumbling in his bag took out\r\na tiny fret saw.  Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift\r\ndownward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was,\r\nhowever, big enough to admit the point of the saw.  I had expected a\r\nrush of gas from the week-old corpse.  We doctors, who have had to\r\nstudy our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I\r\ndrew back towards the door.  But the Professor never stopped for a\r\nmoment.  He sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead\r\ncoffin, and then across, and down the other side.  Taking the edge of\r\nthe loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and\r\nholding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI drew near and looked.  The coffin was empty.  It was certainly a\r\nsurprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was\r\nunmoved.  He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so\r\nemboldened to proceed in his task.  "Are you satisfied now, friend\r\nJohn?" he asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as\r\nI answered him, "I am satisfied that Lucy''s body is not in that\r\ncoffin, but that only proves one thing."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And what is that, friend John?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That it is not there."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes.  But how do you,\r\nhow can you, account for it not being there?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Perhaps a body-snatcher," I suggested.  "Some of the undertaker''s\r\npeople may have stolen it."  I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet\r\nit was the only real cause which I could suggest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor sighed.  "Ah well!" he said, "we must have more proof.\r\nCome with me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe put on the coffin lid again, gathered up all his things and placed\r\nthem in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the\r\nbag.  We opened the door, and went out.  Behind us he closed the door\r\nand locked it.  He handed me the key, saying, "Will you keep it?  You\r\nhad better be assured."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI laughed, it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say, as I\r\nmotioned him to keep it.  "A key is nothing," I said, "there are many\r\nduplicates, and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of this\r\nkind."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe said nothing, but put the key in his pocket.  Then he told me to\r\nwatch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the\r\nother.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI took up my place behind a yew tree, and I saw his dark figure move\r\nuntil the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a lonely vigil.  Just after I had taken my place I heard a\r\ndistant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two.  I was\r\nchilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on\r\nsuch an errand and with myself for coming.  I was too cold and too\r\nsleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my\r\ntrust, so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white\r\nstreak, moving between two dark yew trees at the side of the\r\nchurchyard farthest from the tomb.  At the same time a dark mass moved\r\nfrom the Professor''s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards\r\nit.  Then I too moved, but I had to go round headstones and railed-off\r\ntombs, and I stumbled over graves.  The sky was overcast, and\r\nsomewhere far off an early cock crew.  A little ways off, beyond a\r\nline of scattered juniper trees, which marked the pathway to the\r\nchurch, a white dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb.  The\r\ntomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure\r\nhad disappeared.  I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had\r\nfirst seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor\r\nholding in his arms a tiny child.  When he saw me he held it out to\r\nme, and said, "Are you satisfied now?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No," I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do you not see the child?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?  And is it wounded?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We shall see," said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our\r\nway out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of\r\ntrees, and struck a match, and looked at the child''s throat.  It was\r\nwithout a scratch or scar of any kind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Was I right?" I asked triumphantly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We were just in time," said the Professor thankfully.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so\r\nconsulted about it.  If we were to take it to a police station we\r\nshould have to give some account of our movements during the night.\r\nAt least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had\r\ncome to find the child.  So finally we decided that we would take it\r\nto the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it\r\nwhere he could not fail to find it.  We would then seek our way home\r\nas quickly as we could.  All fell out well.  At the edge of Hampstead\r\nHeath we heard a policeman''s heavy tramp, and laying the child on the\r\npathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his\r\nlantern to and fro.  We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and\r\nthen we went away silently.  By good chance we got a cab near the\r\n''Spainiards,'' and drove to town.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI cannot sleep, so I make this entry.  But I must try to get a few\r\nhours'' sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon.  He insists\r\nthat I go with him on another expedition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n27 September.--It was two o''clock before we found a suitable\r\nopportunity for our attempt.  The funeral held at noon was all\r\ncompleted, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken\r\nthemselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of\r\nalder trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him.  We knew that\r\nwe were safe till morning did we desire it, but the Professor told me\r\nthat we should not want more than an hour at most.  Again I felt that\r\nhorrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of\r\nimagination seemed out of place, and I realized distinctly the perils\r\nof the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work.  Besides, I\r\nfelt it was all so useless.  Outrageous as it was to open a leaden\r\ncoffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now\r\nseemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from\r\nthe evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty.  I\r\nshrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had\r\na way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated.  He took\r\nthe key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to\r\nprecede.  The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how\r\nunutterably mean looking when the sunshine streamed in.  Van Helsing\r\nwalked over to Lucy''s coffin, and I followed.  He bent over and again\r\nforced back the leaden flange, and a shock of surprise and dismay shot\r\nthrough me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her\r\nfuneral.  She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever,\r\nand I could not believe that she was dead.  The lips were red, nay\r\nredder than before, and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Is this a juggle?" I said to him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Are you convinced now?" said the Professor, in response, and as he\r\nspoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled\r\nback the dead lips and showed the white teeth.  "See," he went on,\r\n"they are even sharper than before.  With this and this," and he\r\ntouched one of the canine teeth and that below it, "the little\r\nchildren can be bitten.  Are you of belief now, friend John?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce more argumentative hostility woke within me.  I could not accept\r\nsuch an overwhelming idea as he suggested.  So, with an attempt to\r\nargue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said, "She may have\r\nbeen placed here since last night."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Indeed?  That is so, and by whom?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I do not know.  Someone has done it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And yet she has been dead one week.  Most peoples in that time would\r\nnot look so."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI had no answer for this, so was silent.  Van Helsing did not seem to\r\nnotice my silence.  At any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor\r\ntriumph.  He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman,\r\nraising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the\r\nlips and examining the teeth.  Then he turned to me and said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded.  Here\r\nis some dual life that is not as the common.  She was bitten by the\r\nvampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking, oh, you start.  You\r\ndo not know that, friend John, but you shall know it later, and in\r\ntrance could he best come to take more blood.  In trance she dies, and\r\nin trance she is UnDead, too.  So it is that she differ from all\r\nother.  Usually when the UnDead sleep at home," as he spoke he made a\r\ncomprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was\r\n''home'', "their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was\r\nwhen she not UnDead she go back to the nothings of the common dead.\r\nThere is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill\r\nher in her sleep."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was\r\naccepting Van Helsing''s theories.  But if she were really dead, what\r\nwas there of terror in the idea of killing her?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he\r\nsaid almost joyously, "Ah, you believe now?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI answered, "Do not press me too hard all at once.  I am willing to\r\naccept.  How will you do this bloody work?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall\r\ndrive a stake through her body."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman\r\nwhom I had loved.  And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had\r\nexpected.  I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of\r\nthis being, this UnDead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it.\r\nIs it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as\r\nif wrapped in thought.  Presently he closed the catch of his bag with\r\na snap, and said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best.\r\nIf I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment,\r\nwhat is to be done.  But there are other things to follow, and things\r\nthat are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know.\r\nThis is simple.  She have yet no life taken, though that is of time,\r\nand to act now would be to take danger from her forever.  But then we\r\nmay have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this?  If you,\r\nwho saw the wounds on Lucy''s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on\r\nthe child''s at the hospital, if you, who saw the coffin empty last\r\nnight and full today with a woman who have not change only to be more\r\nrose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die, if you know of\r\nthis and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to\r\nthe churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how\r\nthen, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying.  I\r\nknow he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done\r\nthings that prevent him say goodbye as he ought, and he may think that\r\nin some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive, and that in\r\nmost mistake of all we have killed her.  He will then argue back that\r\nit is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas, and so he\r\nwill be much unhappy always.  Yet he never can be sure, and that is\r\nthe worst of all.  And he will sometimes think that she he loved was\r\nburied alive, and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she\r\nmust have suffered, and again, he will think that we may be right, and\r\nthat his so beloved was, after all, an UnDead.  No!  I told him once,\r\nand since then I learn much.  Now, since I know it is all true, a\r\nhundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the\r\nbitter waters to reach the sweet.  He, poor fellow, must have one hour\r\nthat will make the very face of heaven grow black to him, then we can\r\nact for good all round and send him peace.  My mind is made up.  Let\r\nus go.  You return home for tonight to your asylum, and see that all\r\nbe well.  As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard\r\nin my own way.  Tomorrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley\r\nHotel at ten of the clock.  I shall send for Arthur to come too, and\r\nalso that so fine young man of America that gave his blood.  Later we\r\nshall all have work to do.  I come with you so far as Piccadilly and\r\nthere dine, for I must be back here before the sun set."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the\r\nchurchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to\r\nPiccadilly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNOTE LEFT BY VAN HELSING IN HIS PORTMANTEAU, BERKELEY HOTEL DIRECTED TO\r\nJOHN SEWARD, M. D. (Not Delivered)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n27 September\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Friend John,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I write this in case anything should happen.  I go alone to\r\nwatch in that churchyard.  It pleases me that the UnDead,\r\nMiss Lucy, shall not leave tonight, that so on the morrow\r\nnight she may be more eager.  Therefore I shall fix some\r\nthings she like not, garlic and a crucifix, and so seal up\r\nthe door of the tomb.  She is young as UnDead, and will\r\nheed.  Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out.\r\nThey may not prevail on her wanting to get in, for then the\r\nUnDead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance,\r\nwhatsoever it may be.  I shall be at hand all the night from\r\nsunset till after sunrise, and if there be aught that may be\r\nlearned I shall learn it.  For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no\r\nfear, but that other to whom is there that she is UnDead, he have\r\nnot the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.  He is cunning,\r\nas I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he\r\nhave fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy''s life, and\r\nwe lost, and in many ways the UnDead are strong.  He have always\r\nthe strength in his hand of twenty men, even we four who gave our\r\nstrength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him.  Besides, he can\r\nsummon his wolf and I know not what.  So if it be that he came\r\nthither on this night he shall find me.  But none other shall,\r\nuntil it be too late.  But it may be that he will not attempt the\r\nplace.  There is no reason why he should.  His hunting ground is\r\nmore full of game than the churchyard where the UnDead woman\r\nsleeps, and the one old man watch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Therefore I write this in case&#8230; Take the papers that\r\nare with this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read\r\nthem, and then find this great UnDead, and cut off his head\r\nand burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so that the\r\nworld may rest from him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"If it be so, farewell.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"VAN HELSING."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n28 September.--It is wonderful what a good night''s sleep will do for\r\none.  Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing''s monstrous\r\nideas, but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on\r\ncommon sense.  I have no doubt that he believes it all.  I wonder if\r\nhis mind can have become in any way unhinged.  Surely there must be\r\nsome rational explanation of all these mysterious things.  Is it\r\npossible that the Professor can have done it himself?  He is so\r\nabnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his\r\nintent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way.  I am loathe\r\nto think it, and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the\r\nother to find that Van Helsing was mad, but anyhow I shall watch him\r\ncarefully.  I may get some light on the mystery.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n29 September.--Last night, at a little before ten o''clock, Arthur and\r\nQuincey came into Van Helsing''s room.  He told us all what he wanted\r\nus to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all our\r\nwills were centred in his.  He began by saying that he hoped we would\r\nall come with him too, "for," he said, "there is a grave duty to be\r\ndone there.  You were doubtless surprised at my letter?"  This query\r\nwas directly addressed to Lord Godalming.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I was.  It rather upset me for a bit.  There has been so much trouble\r\naround my house of late that I could do without any more.  I have been\r\ncurious, too, as to what you mean.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Quincey and I talked it over, but the more we talked, the more\r\npuzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that I''m about up a tree\r\nas to any meaning about anything."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Me too," said Quincey Morris laconically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh," said the Professor, "then you are nearer the beginning, both of\r\nyou, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he\r\ncan even get so far as to begin."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was evident that he recognized my return to my old doubting frame\r\nof mind without my saying a word.  Then, turning to the other two, he\r\nsaid with intense gravity,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I want your permission to do what I think good this night.  It is, I\r\nknow, much to ask, and when you know what it is I propose to do you\r\nwill know, and only then how much.  Therefore may I ask that you\r\npromise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry\r\nwith me for a time, I must not disguise from myself the possibility\r\nthat such may be, you shall not blame yourselves for anything."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That''s frank anyhow," broke in Quincey.  "I''ll answer for the\r\nProfessor.  I don''t quite see his drift, but I swear he''s honest, and\r\nthat''s good enough for me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I thank you, Sir," said Van Helsing proudly.  "I have done myself the\r\nhonour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is\r\ndear to me."  He held out a hand, which Quincey took.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen Arthur spoke out, "Dr. Van Helsing, I don''t quite like to ''buy a\r\npig in a poke'', as they say in Scotland, and if it be anything in\r\nwhich my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a Christian is\r\nconcerned, I cannot make such a promise.  If you can assure me that\r\nwhat you intend does not violate either of these two, then I give my\r\nconsent at once, though for the life of me, I cannot understand what\r\nyou are driving at."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I accept your limitation," said Van Helsing, "and all I ask of you is\r\nthat if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will\r\nfirst consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your\r\nreservations."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Agreed!" said Arthur.  "That is only fair.  And now that the\r\npourparlers are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard\r\nat Kingstead."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur''s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Where poor Lucy is buried?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor bowed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur went on, "And when there?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"To enter the tomb!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur stood up.  "Professor, are you in earnest, or is it some\r\nmonstrous joke?  Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest."  He sat\r\ndown again, but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who\r\nis on his dignity.  There was silence until he asked again, "And when\r\nin the tomb?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"To open the coffin."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"This is too much!" he said, angrily rising again.  "I am willing to\r\nbe patient in all things that are reasonable, but in this, this\r\ndesecration of the grave, of one who&#8230;"  He fairly choked with\r\nindignation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor looked pityingly at him.  "If I could spare you one pang,\r\nmy poor friend," he said, "God knows I would.  But this night our feet\r\nmust tread in thorny paths, or later, and for ever, the feet you love\r\nmust walk in paths of flame!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur looked up with set white face and said, "Take care, sir, take\r\ncare!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?" said Van Helsing.\r\n"And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose.  Shall I go\r\non?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That''s fair enough," broke in Morris.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort, "Miss\r\nLucy is dead, is it not so?  Yes!  Then there can be no wrong to her.\r\nBut if she be not dead&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur jumped to his feet, "Good God!" he cried.  "What do you mean?\r\nHas there been any mistake, has she been buried alive?"  He groaned in\r\nanguish that not even hope could soften.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I did not say she was alive, my child.  I did not think it.  I go no\r\nfurther than to say that she might be UnDead."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"UnDead!  Not alive!  What do you mean?  Is this all a nightmare, or\r\nwhat is it?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age\r\nthey may solve only in part.  Believe me, we are now on the verge of\r\none.  But I have not done.  May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Heavens and earth, no!" cried Arthur in a storm of passion.  "Not for\r\nthe wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body.  Dr.\r\nVan Helsing, you try me too far.  What have I done to you that you\r\nshould torture me so?  What did that poor, sweet girl do that you\r\nshould want to cast such dishonour on her grave?  Are you mad, that you\r\nspeak of such things, or am I mad to listen to them?  Don''t dare think\r\nmore of such a desecration.  I shall not give my consent to anything\r\nyou do.  I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage, and\r\nby God, I shall do it!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and\r\nsaid, gravely and sternly, "My Lord Godalming, I too, have a duty to\r\ndo, a duty to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead, and by God, I\r\nshall do it!  All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you\r\nlook and listen, and if when later I make the same request you do not\r\nbe more eager for its fulfillment even than I am, then, I shall do my\r\nduty, whatever it may seem to me.  And then, to follow your Lordship''s\r\nwishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to\r\nyou, when and where you will."  His voice broke a little, and he went\r\non with a voice full of pity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me.  In a long life\r\nof acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did\r\nwring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now.  Believe me\r\nthat if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one\r\nlook from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what\r\na man can to save you from sorrow.  Just think.  For why should I give\r\nmyself so much labor and so much of sorrow?  I have come here from my\r\nown land to do what I can of good, at the first to please my friend\r\nJohn, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom too, I come to love.\r\nFor her, I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness, I gave\r\nwhat you gave, the blood of my veins.  I gave it, I who was not, like\r\nyou, her lover, but only her physician and her friend.  I gave her my\r\nnights and days, before death, after death, and if my death can do her\r\ngood even now, when she is the dead UnDead, she shall have it freely."\r\nHe said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much\r\naffected by it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe took the old man''s hand and said in a broken voice, "Oh, it is hard\r\nto think of it, and I cannot understand, but at least I shall go with\r\nyou and wait."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

SEWARD''S DIARY--cont.\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was just a quarter before twelve o''clock when we got into the\r\nchurchyard over the low wall.  The night was dark with occasional\r\ngleams of moonlight between the dents of the heavy clouds that scudded\r\nacross the sky.  We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing\r\nslightly in front as he led the way.  When we had come close to the\r\ntomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared the proximity to a place\r\nladen with so sorrowful a memory would upset him, but he bore himself\r\nwell.  I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some\r\nway a counteractant to his grief.  The Professor unlocked the door,\r\nand seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved\r\nthe difficulty by entering first himself.  The rest of us followed,\r\nand he closed the door.  He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to a\r\ncoffin.  Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly.  Van Helsing said to me,\r\n"You were with me here yesterday.  Was the body of Miss Lucy in that\r\ncoffin?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It was."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor turned to the rest saying, "You hear, and yet there is\r\nno one who does not believe with me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin.\r\nArthur looked on, very pale but silent.  When the lid was removed he\r\nstepped forward.  He evidently did not know that there was a leaden\r\ncoffin, or at any rate, had not thought of it.  When he saw the rent\r\nin the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as\r\nquickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness.\r\nHe was still silent.  Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and\r\nwe all looked in and recoiled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe coffin was empty!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor several minutes no one spoke a word.  The silence was broken by\r\nQuincey Morris, "Professor, I answered for you.  Your word is all I\r\nwant.  I wouldn''t ask such a thing ordinarily, I wouldn''t so dishonour\r\nyou as to imply a doubt, but this is a mystery that goes beyond any\r\nhonour or dishonour.  Is this your doing?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed or\r\ntouched her.  What happened was this.  Two nights ago my friend Seward\r\nand I came here, with good purpose, believe me.  I opened that coffin,\r\nwhich was then sealed up, and we found it as now, empty.  We then\r\nwaited, and saw something white come through the trees.  The next day\r\nwe came here in daytime and she lay there.  Did she not, friend John?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That night we were just in time.  One more so small child was\r\nmissing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves.\r\nYesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the UnDead can\r\nmove.  I waited here all night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing.\r\nIt was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of\r\nthose doors garlic, which the UnDead cannot bear, and other things\r\nwhich they shun.  Last night there was no exodus, so tonight before\r\nthe sundown I took away my garlic and other things.  And so it is we\r\nfind this coffin empty.  But bear with me.  So far there is much that\r\nis strange.  Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things\r\nmuch stranger are yet to be.  So," here he shut the dark slide of his\r\nlantern, "now to the outside."  He opened the door, and we filed out,\r\nhe coming last and locking the door behind him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOh!  But it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of\r\nthat vault.  How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the\r\npassing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing\r\nand passing, like the gladness and sorrow of a man''s life.  How sweet\r\nit was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay.\r\nHow humanizing to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and\r\nto hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great\r\ncity.  Each in his own way was solemn and overcome.  Arthur was\r\nsilent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the\r\ninner meaning of the mystery.  I was myself tolerably patient, and\r\nhalf inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing''s\r\nconclusions.  Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who\r\naccepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery,\r\nwith hazard of all he has at stake.  Not being able to smoke, he cut\r\nhimself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew.  As to Van\r\nHelsing, he was employed in a definite way.  First he took from his\r\nbag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was\r\ncarefully rolled up in a white napkin.  Next he took out a double\r\nhandful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty.  He crumbled the\r\nwafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands.  This he\r\nthen took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the\r\ncrevices between the door and its setting in the tomb.  I was somewhat\r\npuzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was\r\ndoing.  Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe answered, "I am closing the tomb so that the UnDead may not enter."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And is that stuff you have there going to do it?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What is that which you are using?"  This time the question was by\r\nArthur.  Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The Host.  I brought it from Amsterdam.  I have an Indulgence."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt\r\nindividually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the\r\nProfessor''s, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of\r\nthings, it was impossible to distrust.  In respectful silence we took\r\nthe places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the\r\nsight of any one approaching.  I pitied the others, especially Arthur.\r\nI had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching\r\nhorror, and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs,\r\nfelt my heart sink within me.  Never did tombs look so ghastly white.\r\nNever did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of\r\nfuneral gloom.  Never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously.\r\nNever did bough creak so mysteriously, and never did the far-away\r\nhowling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a long spell of silence, big, aching, void, and then from\r\nthe Professor a keen "S-s-s-s!"  He pointed, and far down the avenue of\r\nyews we saw a white figure advance, a dim white figure, which held\r\nsomething dark at its breast.  The figure stopped, and at the moment a\r\nray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds, and showed in\r\nstartling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of\r\nthe grave.  We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what\r\nwe saw to be a fair-haired child.  There was a pause and a sharp\r\nlittle cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before\r\nthe fire and dreams.  We were starting forward, but the Professor''s\r\nwarning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew tree, kept us back.\r\nAnd then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again.  It was\r\nnow near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held.\r\nMy own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as\r\nwe recognized the features of Lucy Westenra.  Lucy Westenra, but yet\r\nhow changed.  The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless\r\ncruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing stepped out, and obedient to his gesture, we all advanced\r\ntoo.  The four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb.  Van\r\nHelsing raised his lantern and drew the slide.  By the concentrated\r\nlight that fell on Lucy''s face we could see that the lips were crimson\r\nwith fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and\r\nstained the purity of her lawn death-robe.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe shuddered with horror.  I could see by the tremulous light that\r\neven Van Helsing''s iron nerve had failed.  Arthur was next to me, and\r\nif I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Lucy, I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore\r\nher shape, saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat\r\ngives when taken unawares, then her eyes ranged over us.  Lucy''s eyes\r\nin form and colour, but Lucy''s eyes unclean and full of hell fire,\r\ninstead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew.  At that moment the remnant\r\nof my love passed into hate and loathing.  Had she then to be killed,\r\nI could have done it with savage delight.  As she looked, her eyes\r\nblazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a\r\nvoluptuous smile.  Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it!  With a\r\ncareless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the\r\nchild that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast,\r\ngrowling over it as a dog growls over a bone.  The child gave a sharp\r\ncry, and lay there moaning.  There was a cold-bloodedness in the act\r\nwhich wrung a groan from Arthur.  When she advanced to him with\r\noutstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in\r\nhis hands.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,\r\nsaid, "Come to me, Arthur.  Leave these others and come to me.  My\r\narms are hungry for you.  Come, and we can rest together.  Come, my\r\nhusband, come!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was something diabolically sweet in her tones, something of the\r\ntinkling of glass when struck, which rang through the brains even of\r\nus who heard the words addressed to another.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs for Arthur, he seemed under a spell, moving his hands from his\r\nface, he opened wide his arms.  She was leaping for them, when Van\r\nHelsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden\r\ncrucifix.  She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face,\r\nfull of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if\r\narrested by some irresistible force.  Then she turned, and her face\r\nwas shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had\r\nnow no quiver from Van Helsing''s nerves.  Never did I see such baffled\r\nmalice on a face, and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by\r\nmortal eyes.  The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to\r\nthrow out sparks of hell fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the\r\nfolds of flesh were the coils of Medusa''s snakes, and the lovely,\r\nblood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of\r\nthe Greeks and Japanese.  If ever a face meant death, if looks could\r\nkill, we saw it at that moment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained\r\nbetween the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of\r\nentry.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur, "Answer me, oh my\r\nfriend!  Am I to proceed in my work?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do as you will, friend.  Do as you will.  There can be no horror like\r\nthis ever any more."  And he groaned in spirit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nQuincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms.  We\r\ncould hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it\r\ndown.  Coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks\r\nsome of the sacred emblem which he had placed there.  We all looked on\r\nwith horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman,\r\nwith a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass through\r\nthe interstice where scarce a knife blade could have gone.  We all\r\nfelt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring\r\nthe strings of putty to the edges of the door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen this was done, he lifted the child and said, "Come now, my\r\nfriends.  We can do no more till tomorrow.  There is a funeral at\r\nnoon, so here we shall all come before long after that.  The friends\r\nof the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton locks the\r\ngate we shall remain.  Then there is more to do, but not like this of\r\ntonight.  As for this little one, he is not much harmed, and by\r\ntomorrow night he shall be well.  We shall leave him where the police\r\nwill find him, as on the other night, and then to home."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nComing close to Arthur, he said, "My friend Arthur, you have had a sore\r\ntrial, but after, when you look back, you will see how it was\r\nnecessary.  You are now in the bitter waters, my child.  By this time\r\ntomorrow you will, please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the\r\nsweet waters.  So do not mourn over-much.  Till then I shall not ask\r\nyou to forgive me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other\r\non the way.  We had left behind the child in safety, and were tired.\r\nSo we all slept with more or less reality of sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n29 September, night.--A little before twelve o''clock we three, Arthur,\r\nQuincey Morris, and myself, called for the Professor.  It was odd to\r\nnotice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes.  Of\r\ncourse, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest\r\nof us wore it by instinct.  We got to the graveyard by half-past one,\r\nand strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when\r\nthe gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton, under the\r\nbelief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place\r\nall to ourselves.  Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had\r\nwith him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag.  It was\r\nmanifestly of fair weight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up\r\nthe road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the\r\nProfessor to the tomb.  He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing\r\nit behind us.  Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit,\r\nand also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck by melting\r\ntheir own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light\r\nsufficient to work by.  When he again lifted the lid off Lucy''s coffin\r\nwe all looked, Arthur trembling like an aspen, and saw that the corpse\r\nlay there in all its death beauty.  But there was no love in my own\r\nheart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy''s\r\nshape without her soul.  I could see even Arthur''s face grow hard as\r\nhe looked.  Presently he said to Van Helsing, "Is this really Lucy''s\r\nbody, or only a demon in her shape?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is her body, and yet not it.  But wait a while, and you shall see\r\nher as she was, and is."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there, the pointed\r\nteeth, the blood stained, voluptuous mouth, which made one shudder to\r\nsee, the whole carnal and unspirited appearance, seeming like a\r\ndevilish mockery of Lucy''s sweet purity.  Van Helsing, with his usual\r\nmethodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and\r\nplacing them ready for use.  First he took out a soldering iron and\r\nsome plumbing solder, and then small oil lamp, which gave out, when\r\nlit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at a fierce heat with a\r\nblue flame, then his operating knives, which he placed to hand, and\r\nlast a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick\r\nand about three feet long.  One end of it was hardened by charring in\r\nthe fire, and was sharpened to a fine point.  With this stake came a\r\nheavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal cellar for\r\nbreaking the lumps.  To me, a doctor''s preparations for work of any\r\nkind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on\r\nboth Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation.\r\nThey both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen all was ready, Van Helsing said, "Before we do anything, let me\r\ntell you this.  It is out of the lore and experience of the ancients\r\nand of all those who have studied the powers of the UnDead.  When they\r\nbecome such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality.\r\nThey cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and\r\nmultiplying the evils of the world.  For all that die from the preying\r\nof the Undead become themselves Undead, and prey on their kind.  And\r\nso the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone\r\nthrown in the water.  Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which\r\nyou know of before poor Lucy die, or again, last night when you open\r\nyour arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become\r\nnosferatu, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would for all time\r\nmake more of those Un-Deads that so have filled us with horror.  The\r\ncareer of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.  Those children\r\nwhose blood she sucked are not as yet so much the worse, but if she\r\nlives on, UnDead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power\r\nover them they come to her, and so she draw their blood with that so\r\nwicked mouth.  But if she die in truth, then all cease.  The tiny\r\nwounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their play\r\nunknowing ever of what has been.  But of the most blessed of all, when\r\nthis now UnDead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the\r\npoor lady whom we love shall again be free.  Instead of working\r\nwickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it\r\nby day, she shall take her place with the other Angels.  So that, my\r\nfriend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow\r\nthat sets her free.  To this I am willing, but is there none amongst\r\nus who has a better right?  Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in\r\nthe silence of the night when sleep is not, ''It was my hand that sent\r\nher to the stars.  It was the hand of him that loved her best, the\r\nhand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to\r\nchoose?''  Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe all looked at Arthur.  He saw too, what we all did, the infinite\r\nkindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would\r\nrestore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory.  He stepped\r\nforward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was\r\nas pale as snow, "My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I\r\nthank you.  Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said, "Brave lad!  A\r\nmoment''s courage, and it is done.  This stake must be driven through\r\nher.  It well be a fearful ordeal, be not deceived in that, but it\r\nwill be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your\r\npain was great.  From this grim tomb you will emerge as though you\r\ntread on air.  But you must not falter when once you have begun.  Only\r\nthink that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for\r\nyou all the time."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Go on," said Arthur hoarsely.  "Tell me what I am to do."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place to the point over\r\nthe heart, and the hammer in your right.  Then when we begin our\r\nprayer for the dead, I shall read him, I have here the book, and the\r\nothers shall follow, strike in God''s name, that so all may be well\r\nwith the dead that we love and that the UnDead pass away."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set\r\non action his hands never trembled nor even quivered.  Van Helsing\r\nopened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as\r\nwell as we could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its\r\ndint in the white flesh.  Then he struck with all his might.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe thing in the coffin writhed, and a hideous, blood-curdling screech\r\ncame from the opened red lips.  The body shook and quivered and\r\ntwisted in wild contortions.  The sharp white teeth champed together till\r\nthe lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam.  But\r\nArthur never faltered.  He looked like a figure of Thor as his\r\nuntrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the\r\nmercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled\r\nand spurted up around it.  His face was set, and high duty seemed to\r\nshine through it.  The sight of it gave us courage so that our voices\r\nseemed to ring through the little vault.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the\r\nteeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver.  Finally it lay still.\r\nThe terrible task was over.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe hammer fell from Arthur''s hand.  He reeled and would have fallen\r\nhad we not caught him.  The great drops of sweat sprang from his\r\nforehead, and his breath came in broken gasps.  It had indeed been an\r\nawful strain on him, and had he not been forced to his task by more\r\nthan human considerations he could never have gone through with it.\r\nFor a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look\r\ntowards the coffin.  When we did, however, a murmur of startled\r\nsurprise ran from one to the other of us.  We gazed so eagerly that\r\nArthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked\r\ntoo, and then a glad strange light broke over his face and dispelled\r\naltogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so\r\ndreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded\r\nas a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen\r\nher in life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity.  True\r\nthat there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care\r\nand pain and waste.  But these were all dear to us, for they marked\r\nher truth to what we knew.  One and all we felt that the holy calm\r\nthat lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an\r\nearthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur''s shoulder, and said to\r\nhim, "And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man''s hand\r\nin his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said, "Forgiven!\r\nGod bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again, and me\r\npeace."  He put his hands on the Professor''s shoulder, and laying his\r\nhead on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood\r\nunmoving.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he raised his head Van Helsing said to him, "And now, my child,\r\nyou may kiss her.  Kiss her dead lips if you will, as she would have\r\nyou to, if for her to choose.  For she is not a grinning devil now,\r\nnot any more a foul Thing for all eternity.  No longer she is the\r\ndevil''s UnDead.  She is God''s true dead, whose soul is with Him!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the\r\ntomb.  The Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the\r\npoint of it in the body.  Then we cut off the head and filled the\r\nmouth with garlic.  We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the\r\ncoffin lid, and gathering up our belongings, came away.  When the\r\nProfessor locked the door he gave the key to Arthur.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOutside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it\r\nseemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch.  There was\r\ngladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves\r\non one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore we moved away Van Helsing said, "Now, my friends, one step of\r\nour work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves.  But there\r\nremains a greater task: to find out the author of all this our sorrow\r\nand to stamp him out.  I have clues which we can follow, but it is a\r\nlong task, and a difficult one, and there is danger in it, and pain.\r\nShall you not all help me?  We have learned to believe, all of us, is\r\nit not so?  And since so, do we not see our duty?  Yes!  And do we not\r\npromise to go on to the bitter end?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEach in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made.  Then said\r\nthe Professor as we moved off, "Two nights hence you shall meet with\r\nme and dine together at seven of the clock with friend John.  I shall\r\nentreat two others, two that you know not as yet, and I shall be ready\r\nto all our work show and our plans unfold.  Friend John, you come with\r\nme home, for I have much to consult you about, and you can help me.\r\nTonight I leave for Amsterdam, but shall return tomorrow night.  And\r\nthen begins our great quest.  But first I shall have much to say, so\r\nthat you may know what to do and to dread.  Then our promise shall be\r\nmade to each other anew.  For there is a terrible task before us, and\r\nonce our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

SEWARD''S DIARY--cont.\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we arrived at the Berkely Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram\r\nwaiting for him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Am coming up by train.  Jonathan at Whitby.  Important news.  Mina\r\nHarker."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor was delighted.  "Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina," he\r\nsaid, "pearl among women!  She arrive, but I cannot stay.  She must go\r\nto your house, friend John.  You must meet her at the station.\r\nTelegraph her en route so that she may be prepared."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the wire was dispatched he had a cup of tea.  Over it he told me\r\nof a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a\r\ntypewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker''s diary at Whitby.\r\n"Take these," he said, "and study them well.  When I have returned you\r\nwill be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our\r\ninquisition.  Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure.\r\nYou will need all your faith, even you who have had such an experience\r\nas that of today.  What is here told," he laid his hand heavily and\r\ngravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, "may be the beginning of\r\nthe end to you and me and many another, or it may sound the knell of\r\nthe UnDead who walk the earth.  Read all, I pray you, with the open\r\nmind, and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so, for\r\nit is all important.  You have kept a diary of all these so strange\r\nthings, is it not so?  Yes!  Then we shall go through all these\r\ntogether when we meet."  He then made ready for his departure and\r\nshortly drove off to Liverpool Street.  I took my way to Paddington,\r\nwhere I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival\r\nplatforms, and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my\r\nguest, when a sweet-faced, dainty looking girl stepped up to me, and\r\nafter a quick glance said, "Dr. Seward, is it not?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And you are Mrs. Harker!" I answered at once, whereupon she held out\r\nher hand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy, but&#8230;"  She\r\nstopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for\r\nit was a tacit answer to her own.  I got her luggage, which included a\r\ntypewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I\r\nhad sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting room and a bedroom\r\nprepared at once for Mrs. Harker.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn due time we arrived.  She knew, of course, that the place was a\r\nlunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a\r\nshudder when we entered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study,\r\nas she had much to say.  So here I am finishing my entry in my\r\nphonograph diary whilst I await her.  As yet I have not had the chance\r\nof looking at the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they\r\nlie open before me.  I must get her interested in something, so that I\r\nmay have an opportunity of reading them.  She does not know how\r\nprecious time is, or what a task we have in hand.  I must be careful\r\nnot to frighten her.  Here she is!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n29 September.--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward''s\r\nstudy.  At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him\r\ntalking with some one.  As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I\r\nknocked at the door, and on his calling out, "Come in," I entered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo my intense surprise, there was no one with him.  He was quite\r\nalone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the\r\ndescription to be a phonograph.  I had never seen one, and was much\r\ninterested.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I hope I did not keep you waiting," I said, "but I stayed at the door\r\nas I heard you talking, and thought there was someone with you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh," he replied with a smile, "I was only entering my diary."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Your diary?" I asked him in surprise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes," he answered.  "I keep it in this."  As he spoke he laid his\r\nhand on the phonograph.  I felt quite excited over it, and blurted\r\nout, "Why, this beats even shorthand!  May I hear it say something?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Certainly," he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train\r\nfor speaking.  Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his\r\nface.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The fact is," he began awkwardly, "I only keep my diary in it, and as\r\nit is entirely, almost entirely, about my cases it may be awkward,\r\nthat is, I mean&#8230;"  He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his\r\nembarrassment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end.  Let me hear how she died,\r\nfor all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful.  She was very,\r\nvery dear to me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face,\r\n"Tell you of her death?  Not for the wide world!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Why not?" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAgain he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an\r\nexcuse.  At length, he stammered out, "You see, I do not know how to\r\npick out any particular part of the diary."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEven while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said with\r\nunconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naivete of\r\na child, "that''s quite true, upon my honour.  Honest Indian!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could not but smile, at which he grimaced.  "I gave myself away that\r\ntime!" he said.  "But do you know that, although I have kept the diary\r\nfor months past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any\r\nparticular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who\r\nattended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge\r\nof that terrible Being, and I said boldly, "Then, Dr. Seward, you had\r\nbetter let me copy it out for you on my typewriter."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said, "No!  No!  No!  For\r\nall the world.  I wouldn''t let you know that terrible story!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen it was terrible.  My intuition was right!  For a moment, I\r\nthought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for\r\nsomething or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of\r\ntypewriting on the table.  His eyes caught the look in mine, and\r\nwithout his thinking, followed their direction.  As they saw the\r\nparcel he realized my meaning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You do not know me," I said.  "When you have read those papers, my\r\nown diary and my husband''s also, which I have typed, you will know me\r\nbetter.  I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart\r\nin this cause.  But, of course, you do not know me, yet, and I must\r\nnot expect you to trust me so far."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe is certainly a man of noble nature.  Poor dear Lucy was right about\r\nhim.  He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in\r\norder a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and\r\nsaid,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You are quite right.  I did not trust you because I did not know\r\nyou.  But I know you now, and let me say that I should have known you\r\nlong ago.  I know that Lucy told you of me.  She told me of you too.\r\nMay I make the only atonement in my power?  Take the cylinders and\r\nhear them.  The first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they\r\nwill not horrify you.  Then you will know me better.  Dinner will by\r\nthen be ready.  In the meantime I shall read over some of these\r\ndocuments, and shall be better able to understand certain things."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting room and adjusted\r\nit for me.  Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am sure.  For it\r\nwill tell me the other side of a true love episode of which I know one\r\nside already.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n29 September.--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan\r\nHarker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without\r\nthinking.  Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce\r\ndinner, so I said, "She is possibly tired.  Let dinner wait an hour,"\r\nand I went on with my work.  I had just finished Mrs. Harker''s diary,\r\nwhen she came in.  She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her\r\neyes were flushed with crying.  This somehow moved me much.  Of late I\r\nhave had cause for tears, God knows!  But the relief of them was\r\ndenied me, and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened by recent\r\ntears, went straight to my heart.  So I said as gently as I could, "I\r\ngreatly fear I have distressed you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, no, not distressed me," she replied.  "But I have been more\r\ntouched than I can say by your grief.  That is a wonderful machine,\r\nbut it is cruelly true.  It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of\r\nyour heart.  It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God.  No one\r\nmust hear them spoken ever again!  See, I have tried to be useful.  I\r\nhave copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other need now\r\nhear your heart beat, as I did."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No one need ever know, shall ever know," I said in a low voice.  She\r\nlaid her hand on mine and said very gravely, "Ah, but they must!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Must!  But why?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor Lucy''s\r\ndeath and all that led to it.  Because in the struggle which we have\r\nbefore us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all\r\nthe knowledge and all the help which we can get.  I think that the\r\ncylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to\r\nknow.  But I can see that there are in your record many lights to this\r\ndark mystery.  You will let me help, will you not?  I know all up to a\r\ncertain point, and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7\r\nSeptember, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was\r\nbeing wrought out.  Jonathan and I have been working day and night\r\nsince Professor Van Helsing saw us.  He is gone to Whitby to get more\r\ninformation, and he will be here tomorrow to help us.  We need have no\r\nsecrets amongst us.  Working together and with absolute trust, we can\r\nsurely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked at me so appealingly, and at the same time manifested such\r\ncourage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once to her\r\nwishes.  "You shall," I said, "do as you like in the matter.  God\r\nforgive me if I do wrong!  There are terrible things yet to learn of,\r\nbut if you have so far traveled on the road to poor Lucy''s death, you\r\nwill not be content, I know, to remain in the dark.  Nay, the end, the\r\nvery end, may give you a gleam of peace.  Come, there is dinner.  We\r\nmust keep one another strong for what is before us.  We have a cruel\r\nand dreadful task.  When you have eaten you shall learn the rest, and\r\nI shall answer any questions you ask, if there be anything which you\r\ndo not understand, though it was apparent to us who were present."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n29 September.--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study.  He\r\nbrought back the phonograph from my room, and I took a chair, and\r\narranged the phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up,\r\nand showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause.  Then he\r\nvery thoughtfully took a chair, with his back to me, so that I might\r\nbe as free as possible, and began to read.  I put the forked metal to\r\nmy ears and listened.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the terrible story of Lucy''s death, and all that followed, was\r\ndone, I lay back in my chair powerless.  Fortunately I am not of a\r\nfainting disposition.  When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a\r\nhorrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case bottle from the\r\ncupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat\r\nrestored me.  My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came\r\nthrough all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my\r\ndear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it\r\nwithout making a scene.  It is all so wild and mysterious, and strange\r\nthat if I had not known Jonathan''s experience in Transylvania I could\r\nnot have believed.  As it was, I didn''t know what to believe, and so\r\ngot out of my difficulty by attending to something else.  I took the\r\ncover off my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Let me write this all out now.  We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing\r\nwhen he comes.  I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here\r\nwhen he arrives in London from Whitby.  In this matter dates are\r\neverything, and I think that if we get all of our material ready, and\r\nhave every item put in chronological order, we shall have done much.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too.  Let\r\nus be able to tell them when they come."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to\r\ntypewrite from the beginning of the seventeenth cylinder.  I used\r\nmanifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done\r\nwith the rest.  It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went\r\nabout his work of going his round of the patients.  When he had\r\nfinished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel\r\ntoo lonely whilst I worked.  How good and thoughtful he is.  The world\r\nseems full of good men, even if there are monsters in it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the\r\nProfessor''s perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at\r\nthe station at Exeter, so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his\r\nnewspapers, I borrowed the files of ''The Westminster Gazette'' and ''The\r\nPall Mall Gazette'' and took them to my room.  I remember how much the\r\n''Dailygraph'' and ''The Whitby Gazette'', of which I had made cuttings,\r\nhad helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count\r\nDracula landed, so I shall look through the evening papers since then,\r\nand perhaps I shall get some new light.  I am not sleepy, and the work\r\nwill help to keep me quiet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 September.--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o''clock.  He got his wife''s\r\nwire just before starting.  He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge\r\nfrom his face, and full of energy.  If this journal be true, and\r\njudging by one''s own wonderful experiences, it must be, he is also a\r\nman of great nerve.  That going down to the vault a second time was a\r\nremarkable piece of daring.  After reading his account of it I was\r\nprepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,\r\nbusinesslike gentleman who came here today.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLATER.--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,\r\nand as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter.  They\r\nare hard at it.  Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in\r\nchronological order every scrap of evidence they have.  Harker has got\r\nthe letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the\r\ncarriers in London who took charge of them.  He is now reading his\r\nwife''s transcript of my diary.  I wonder what they make out of it.\r\nHere it is&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStrange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the\r\nCount''s hiding place!  Goodness knows that we had enough clues from\r\nthe conduct of the patient Renfield!  The bundle of letters relating\r\nto the purchase of the house were with the transcript.  Oh, if we had\r\nonly had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!  Stop!  That way\r\nmadness lies!  Harker has gone back, and is again collecting material.\r\nHe says that by dinner time they will be able to show a whole\r\nconnected narrative.  He thinks that in the meantime I should see\r\nRenfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and\r\ngoing of the Count.  I hardly see this yet, but when I get at the\r\ndates I suppose I shall.  What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my\r\ncylinders into type!  We never could have found the dates otherwise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded,\r\nsmiling benignly.  At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever\r\nsaw.  I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of\r\nwhich he treated naturally.  He then, of his own accord, spoke of\r\ngoing home, a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during\r\nhis sojourn here.  In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his\r\ndischarge at once.  I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker\r\nand read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should have\r\nbeen prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation.  As\r\nit is, I am darkly suspicious.  All those out-breaks were in some way\r\nlinked with the proximity of the Count.  What then does this absolute\r\ncontent mean?  Can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the\r\nvampire''s ultimate triumph?  Stay.  He is himself zoophagous, and in\r\nhis wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he\r\nalways spoke of ''master''.  This all seems confirmation of our idea.\r\nHowever, after a while I came away.  My friend is just a little too\r\nsane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions.\r\nHe might begin to think, and then&#8230; So I came away.  I mistrust\r\nthese quiet moods of his, so I have given the attendant a hint to\r\nlook closely after him, and to have a strait waistcoat ready in case\r\nof need.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJOHNATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n29 September, in train to London.--When I received Mr. Billington''s\r\ncourteous message that he would give me any information in his power I\r\nthought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such\r\ninquiries as I wanted.  It was now my object to trace that horrid\r\ncargo of the Count''s to its place in London.  Later, we may be able to\r\ndeal with it.  Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station,\r\nand brought me to his father''s house, where they had decided that I\r\nmust spend the night.  They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire\r\nhospitality, give a guest everything and leave him to do as he likes.\r\nThey all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr.\r\nBillington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the\r\nconsignment of boxes.  It gave me almost a turn to see again one of\r\nthe letters which I had seen on the Count''s table before I knew of his\r\ndiabolical plans.  Everything had been carefully thought out, and done\r\nsystematically and with precision.  He seemed to have been prepared\r\nfor every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his\r\nintentions being carried out.  To use an Americanism, he had ''taken no\r\nchances'', and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were\r\nfulfilled was simply the logical result of his care.  I saw the\r\ninvoice, and took note of it.  ''Fifty cases of common earth, to be used\r\nfor experimental purposes''.  Also the copy of the letter to Carter\r\nPaterson, and their reply.  Of both these I got copies.  This was all\r\nthe information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the\r\nport and saw the coastguards, the Customs Officers and the harbour\r\nmaster, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had\r\nactually received the boxes.  Their tally was exact with the list, and\r\nthey had nothing to add to the simple description ''fifty cases of\r\ncommon earth'', except that the boxes were ''main and mortal heavy'', and\r\nthat shifting them was dry work.  One of them added that it was hard\r\nlines that there wasn''t any gentleman ''such like as like yourself,\r\nsquire'', to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a\r\nliquid form.  Another put in a rider that the thirst then generated\r\nwas such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely\r\nallayed it.  Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift,\r\nforever and adequately, this source of reproach.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 September.--The station master was good enough to give me a line to\r\nhis old companion the station master at King''s Cross, so that when I\r\narrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival\r\nof the boxes.  He, too put me at once in communication with the proper\r\nofficials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original\r\ninvoice.  The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been\r\nhere limited.  A noble use of them had, however, been made, and again\r\nI was compelled to deal with the result in ex post facto manner.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom thence I went to Carter Paterson''s central office, where I met\r\nwith the utmost courtesy.  They looked up the transaction in their day\r\nbook and letter book, and at once telephoned to their King''s Cross\r\noffice for more details.  By good fortune, the men who did the teaming\r\nwere waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over,\r\nsending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected\r\nwith the delivery of the boxes at Carfax.  Here again I found the\r\ntally agreeing exactly.  The carriers'' men were able to supplement the\r\npaucity of the written words with a few more details.  These were, I\r\nshortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the\r\njob, and the consequent thirst engendered in the operators.  On my\r\naffording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the\r\nrealm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one\r\nof the men remarked,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That ''ere ''ouse, guv''nor, is the rummiest I ever was in.  Blyme!  But\r\nit ain''t been touched sence a hundred years.  There was dust that\r\nthick in the place that you might have slep'' on it without ''urtin'' of\r\nyer bones.  An'' the place was that neglected that yer might ''ave\r\nsmelled ole Jerusalem in it.  But the old chapel, that took the cike,\r\nthat did!  Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn''t never git out quick\r\nenough.  Lor'', I wouldn''t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there\r\narter dark."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHaving been in the house, I could well believe him, but if he knew\r\nwhat I know, he would, I think have raised his terms.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf one thing I am now satisfied.  That all those boxes which arrived at\r\nWhitby from Varna in the Demeter were safely deposited in the old\r\nchapel at Carfax.  There should be fifty of them there, unless any\r\nhave since been removed, as from Dr. Seward''s diary I fear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers\r\ninto order.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 September.--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.\r\nIt is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have\r\nhad, that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound\r\nmight act detrimentally on Jonathan.  I saw him leave for Whitby with\r\nas brave a face as could, but I was sick with apprehension.  The\r\neffort has, however, done him good.  He was never so resolute, never\r\nso strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present.  It is\r\njust as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said, he is true grit,\r\nand he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature.  He came\r\nback full of life and hope and determination.  We have got everything\r\nin order for tonight.  I feel myself quite wild with excitement.  I\r\nsuppose one ought to pity anything so hunted as the Count.  That is\r\njust it.  This thing is not human, not even a beast.  To read Dr.\r\nSeward''s account of poor Lucy''s death, and what followed, is enough to\r\ndry up the springs of pity in one''s heart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we\r\nexpected.  Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with\r\nhim, so I had to see them.  It was to me a painful meeting, for it\r\nbrought back all poor dear Lucy''s hopes of only a few months ago.  Of\r\ncourse they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van\r\nHelsing, too, had been quite ''blowing my trumpet'', as Mr. Morris\r\nexpressed it.  Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all\r\nabout the proposals they made to Lucy.  They did not quite know what\r\nto say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge.  So\r\nthey had to keep on neutral subjects.  However, I thought the matter\r\nover, and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would\r\nbe to post them on affairs right up to date.  I knew from Dr. Seward''s\r\ndiary that they had been at Lucy''s death, her real death, and that I\r\nneed not fear to betray any secret before the time.  So I told them,\r\nas well as I could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and\r\nthat my husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished\r\nputting them in order.  I gave them each a copy to read in the\r\nlibrary.  When Lord Godalming got his and turned it over, it does make\r\na pretty good pile, he said, "Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI nodded, and he went on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I don''t quite see the drift of it, but you people are all so good and\r\nkind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that\r\nall I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you.  I\r\nhave had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man\r\nhumble to the last hour of his life.  Besides, I know you loved my\r\nLucy&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere he turned away and covered his face with his hands.  I could hear\r\nthe tears in his voice.  Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just\r\nlaid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out\r\nof the room.  I suppose there is something in a woman''s nature that\r\nmakes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on\r\nthe tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his\r\nmanhood.  For when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat\r\ndown on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly.  I sat down beside\r\nhim and took his hand.  I hope he didn''t think it forward of me, and\r\nthat if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a\r\nthought.  There I wrong him.  I know he never will.  He is too true a\r\ngentleman.  I said to him, for I could see that his heart was\r\nbreaking, "I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what\r\nyou were to her.  She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone,\r\nwill you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?  I know\r\nwhat sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them.\r\nIf sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won''t you let me be\r\nof some little service, for Lucy''s sake?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief.  It\r\nseemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence\r\nfound a vent at once.  He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open\r\nhands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief.  He stood\r\nup and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks.  I\r\nfelt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly.  With\r\na sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child,\r\nwhilst he shook with emotion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above\r\nsmaller matters when the mother spirit is invoked.  I felt this big\r\nsorrowing man''s head resting on me, as though it were that of a baby\r\nthat some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he\r\nwere my own child.  I never thought at the time how strange it all\r\nwas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an\r\napology, though he made no disguise of his emotion.  He told me that\r\nfor days and nights past, weary days and sleepless nights, he had been\r\nunable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of\r\nsorrow.  There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or\r\nwith whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow\r\nwas surrounded, he could speak freely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I know now how I suffered," he said, as he dried his eyes, "but I do\r\nnot know even yet, and none other can ever know, how much your sweet\r\nsympathy has been to me today.  I shall know better in time, and\r\nbelieve me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will\r\ngrow with my understanding.  You will let me be like a brother, will\r\nyou not, for all our lives, for dear Lucy''s sake?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"For dear Lucy''s sake," I said as we clasped hands.  "Ay, and for your\r\nown sake," he added, "for if a man''s esteem and gratitude are ever\r\nworth the winning, you have won mine today.  If ever the future should\r\nbring to you a time when you need a man''s help, believe me, you will\r\nnot call in vain.  God grant that no such time may ever come to you to\r\nbreak the sunshine of your life, but if it should ever come, promise\r\nme that you will let me know."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would\r\ncomfort him, so I said, "I promise."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.\r\nHe turned as he heard my footsteps.  "How is Art?" he said.  Then\r\nnoticing my red eyes, he went on, "Ah, I see you have been comforting\r\nhim.  Poor old fellow!  He needs it.  No one but a woman can help a\r\nman when he is in trouble of the heart, and he had no one to comfort\r\nhim."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him.  I saw\r\nthe manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would\r\nrealize how much I knew, so I said to him, "I wish I could comfort all\r\nwho suffer from the heart.  Will you let me be your friend, and will\r\nyou come to me for comfort if you need it?  You will know later why I\r\nspeak."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand, and raising\r\nit to his lips, kissed it.  It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and\r\nunselfish a soul, and impulsively I bent over and kissed him.  The\r\ntears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in his\r\nthroat.  He said quite calmly, "Little girl, you will never forget\r\nthat true hearted kindness, so long as ever you live!"  Then he went\r\ninto the study to his friend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Little girl!"  The very words he had used to Lucy, and, oh, but he\r\nproved himself a friend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 September.--I got home at five o''clock, and found that Godalming\r\nand Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the\r\ntranscript of the various diaries and letters which Harker had not yet\r\nreturned from his visit to the carriers'' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey\r\nhad written to me.  Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can\r\nhonestly say that, for the first time since I have lived in it, this\r\nold house seemed like home.  When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour?  I want to see your patient, Mr.\r\nRenfield.  Do let me see him.  What you have said of him in your diary\r\ninterests me so much!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her, and\r\nthere was no possible reason why I should, so I took her with me.\r\nWhen I went into the room, I told the man that a lady would like to see\r\nhim, to which he simply answered, "Why?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it," I\r\nanswered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, very well," he said, "let her come in, by all means, but just\r\nwait a minute till I tidy up the place."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis method of tidying was peculiar, he simply swallowed all the flies\r\nand spiders in the boxes before I could stop him.  It was quite\r\nevident that he feared, or was jealous of, some interference.  When he\r\nhad got through his disgusting task, he said cheerfully, "Let the lady\r\ncome in," and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but\r\nwith his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered.  For\r\na moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent.  I\r\nremembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own\r\nstudy, and I took care to stand where I could seize him at once if he\r\nattempted to make a spring at her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once\r\ncommand the respect of any lunatic, for easiness is one of the\r\nqualities mad people most respect.  She walked over to him, smiling\r\npleasantly, and held out her hand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good evening, Mr. Renfield," said she.  "You see, I know you, for Dr.\r\nSeward has told me of you."  He made no immediate reply, but eyed her\r\nall over intently with a set frown on his face.  This look gave way to\r\none of wonder, which merged in doubt, then to my intense astonishment\r\nhe said, "You''re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you?  You\r\ncan''t be, you know, for she''s dead."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied, "Oh no!  I have a husband\r\nof my own, to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he\r\nme.  I am Mrs. Harker."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then what are you doing here?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then don''t stay."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But why not?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to\r\nMrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in, "How did you\r\nknow I wanted to marry anyone?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned\r\nhis eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again,\r\n"What an asinine question!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I don''t see that at all, Mr. Renfield," said Mrs. Harker, at once\r\nchampioning me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown\r\ncontempt to me, "You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that\r\nwhen a man is so loved and honoured as our host is, everything\r\nregarding him is of interest in our little community.  Dr. Seward is\r\nloved not only by his household and his friends, but even by his\r\npatients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are\r\napt to distort causes and effects.  Since I myself have been an inmate\r\nof a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies\r\nof some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and\r\nignoratio elenche."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI positively opened my eyes at this new development.  Here was my own\r\npet lunatic, the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with,\r\ntalking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished\r\ngentleman.  I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker''s presence which had\r\ntouched some chord in his memory.  If this new phase was spontaneous,\r\nor in any way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some\r\nrare gift or power.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe continued to talk for some time, and seeing that he was seemingly\r\nquite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she\r\nbegan, to lead him to his favourite topic.  I was again astonished,\r\nfor he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of\r\nthe completest sanity.  He even took himself as an example when he\r\nmentioned certain things.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief.\r\nIndeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on\r\nmy being put under control.  I used to fancy that life was a positive\r\nand perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live\r\nthings, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might\r\nindefinitely prolong life.  At times I held the belief so strongly\r\nthat I actually tried to take human life.  The doctor here will bear\r\nme out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of\r\nstrengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of\r\nhis life through the medium of his blood, relying of course, upon the\r\nScriptural phrase, ''For the blood is the life.''  Though, indeed, the\r\nvendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarized the truism to the very\r\npoint of contempt.  Isn''t that true, doctor?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either\r\nthink or say, it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his\r\nspiders and flies not five minutes before.  Looking at my watch, I saw\r\nthat I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.\r\nHarker that it was time to leave.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield, "Goodbye,\r\nand I hope I may see you often, under auspices pleasanter to\r\nyourself."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo which, to my astonishment, he replied, "Goodbye, my dear.  I pray\r\nGod I may never see your sweet face again.  May He bless and keep\r\nyou!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind\r\nme.  Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first\r\ntook ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has\r\nbeen for many a long day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a\r\nboy.  He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying, "Ah, friend\r\nJohn, how goes all?  Well?  So!  I have been busy, for I come here to\r\nstay if need be.  All affairs are settled with me, and I have much to\r\ntell.  Madam Mina is with you?  Yes.  And her so fine husband?  And\r\nArthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too?  Good!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my\r\nown diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker''s suggestion,\r\nat which the Professor interrupted me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina!  She has man''s brain, a brain that a\r\nman should have were he much gifted, and a woman''s heart.  The good\r\nGod fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good\r\ncombination.  Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of\r\nhelp to us, after tonight she must not have to do with this so\r\nterrible affair.  It is not good that she run a risk so great.  We men\r\nare determined, nay, are we not pledged, to destroy this monster?  But\r\nit is no part for a woman.  Even if she be not harmed, her heart may\r\nfail her in so much and so many horrors and hereafter she may suffer,\r\nboth in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams.  And,\r\nbesides, she is young woman and not so long married, there may be\r\nother things to think of some time, if not now.  You tell me she has\r\nwrote all, then she must consult with us, but tomorrow she say goodbye\r\nto this work, and we go alone."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in\r\nhis absence, that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next\r\none to my own.  He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on\r\nhim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh that we had known it before!" he said, "for then we might have\r\nreached him in time to save poor Lucy.  However, ''the milk that is\r\nspilt cries not out afterwards,'' as you say.  We shall not think of\r\nthat, but go on our way to the end."  Then he fell into a silence that\r\nlasted till we entered my own gateway.  Before we went to prepare for\r\ndinner he said to Mrs. Harker, "I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend\r\nJohn that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things\r\nthat have been, up to this moment."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Not up to this moment, Professor," she said impulsively, "but up to\r\nthis morning."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But why not up to now?  We have seen hitherto how good light all the\r\nlittle things have made.  We have told our secrets, and yet no one who\r\nhas told is the worse for it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she\r\nsaid, "Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go\r\nin.  It is my record of today.  I too have seen the need of putting\r\ndown at present everything, however trivial, but there is little in\r\nthis except what is personal.  Must it go in?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back, saying, "It\r\nneed not go in if you do not wish it, but I pray that it may.  It can\r\nbut make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends,\r\nmore honour you, as well as more esteem and love."  She took it back\r\nwith another blush and a bright smile.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete\r\nand in order.  The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,\r\nand before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o''clock.  The rest of\r\nus have already read everything, so when we meet in the study we shall\r\nall be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with\r\nthis terrible and mysterious enemy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 September.--When we met in Dr. Seward''s study two hours after\r\ndinner, which had been at six o''clock, we unconsciously formed a sort\r\nof board or committee.  Professor Van Helsing took the head of the\r\ntable, to which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room.  He\r\nmade me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act as\r\nsecretary.  Jonathan sat next to me.  Opposite us were Lord Godalming,\r\nDr. Seward, and Mr. Morris, Lord Godalming being next the Professor,\r\nand Dr. Seward in the centre.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor said, "I may, I suppose, take it that we are all\r\nacquainted with the facts that are in these papers."  We all expressed\r\nassent, and he went on, "Then it were, I think, good that I tell you\r\nsomething of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal.  I shall\r\nthen make known to you something of the history of this man, which has\r\nbeen ascertained for me.  So we then can discuss how we shall act, and\r\ncan take our measure according.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There are such beings as vampires, some of us have evidence that they\r\nexist.  Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the\r\nteachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane\r\npeoples.  I admit that at the first I was sceptic.  Were it not that\r\nthrough long years I have trained myself to keep an open mind, I could\r\nnot have believed until such time as that fact thunder on my ear.  ''See!\r\nSee!  I prove, I prove.''  Alas!  Had I known at first what now I know,\r\nnay, had I even guess at him, one so precious life had been spared to\r\nmany of us who did love her.  But that is gone, and we must so work,\r\nthat other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save.  The nosferatu\r\ndo not die like the bee when he sting once.  He is only stronger, and\r\nbeing stronger, have yet more power to work evil.  This vampire which\r\nis amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men, he is\r\nof cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages, he\r\nhave still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply,\r\nthe divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to\r\nare for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil\r\nin callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within his range,\r\ndirect the elements, the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command\r\nall the meaner things, the rat, and the owl, and the bat, the moth,\r\nand the fox, and the wolf, he can grow and become small; and he can at\r\ntimes vanish and come unknown.  How then are we to begin our strike to\r\ndestroy him?  How shall we find his where, and having found it, how\r\ncan we destroy?  My friends, this is much, it is a terrible task that\r\nwe undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder.\r\nFor if we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where\r\nend we?  Life is nothings, I heed him not.  But to fail here, is not\r\nmere life or death.  It is that we become as him, that we henceforward\r\nbecome foul things of the night like him, without heart or conscience,\r\npreying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best.  To us\r\nforever are the gates of heaven shut, for who shall open them to us\r\nagain?  We go on for all time abhorred by all, a blot on the face of\r\nGod''s sunshine, an arrow in the side of Him who died for man.  But we\r\nare face to face with duty, and in such case must we shrink?  For me,\r\nI say no, but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair\r\nplaces, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind.  You\r\nothers are young.  Some have seen sorrow, but there are fair days yet\r\nin store.  What say you?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand.  I feared, oh so\r\nmuch, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when\r\nI saw his hand stretch out, but it was life to me to feel its touch,\r\nso strong, so self reliant, so resolute.  A brave man''s hand can speak\r\nfor itself, it does not even need a woman''s love to hear its music.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and\r\nI in his, there was no need for speaking between us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I answer for Mina and myself," he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Count me in, Professor," said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as\r\nusual.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I am with you," said Lord Godalming, "for Lucy''s sake, if for no\r\nother reason."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Seward simply nodded.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor stood up and, after laying his golden crucifix on the\r\ntable, held out his hand on either side.  I took his right hand, and\r\nLord Godalming his left, Jonathan held my right with his left and\r\nstretched across to Mr. Morris.  So as we all took hands our solemn\r\ncompact was made.  I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even occur\r\nto me to draw back.  We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went\r\non with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had\r\nbegun.  It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,\r\nas any other transaction of life.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, you know what we have to contend against, but we too, are not\r\nwithout strength.  We have on our side power of combination, a power\r\ndenied to the vampire kind, we have sources of science, we are free to\r\nact and think, and the hours of the day and the night are ours\r\nequally.  In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered,\r\nand we are free to use them.  We have self devotion in a cause and an\r\nend to achieve which is not a selfish one.  These things are much.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are\r\nrestrict, and how the individual cannot.  In fine, let us consider the\r\nlimitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions.  These do\r\nnot at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and\r\ndeath, nay of more than either life or death.  Yet must we be\r\nsatisfied, in the first place because we have to be, no other means is\r\nat our control, and secondly, because, after all these things,\r\ntradition and superstition, are everything.  Does not the belief in\r\nvampires rest for others, though not, alas! for us, on them?  A year\r\nago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst\r\nof our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century?  We\r\neven scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes.  Take\r\nit, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his\r\ncure, rest for the moment on the same base.  For, let me tell you, he\r\nis known everywhere that men have been.  In old Greece, in old Rome,\r\nhe flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the\r\nChermosese, and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is\r\nhe, and the peoples for him at this day.  He have follow the wake of\r\nthe berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon,\r\nthe Magyar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"So far, then, we have all we may act upon, and let me tell you that\r\nvery much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own\r\nso unhappy experience.  The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere\r\npassing of the time, he can flourish when that he can fatten on the\r\nblood of the living.  Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can\r\neven grow younger, that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem\r\nas though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But he cannot flourish without this diet, he eat not as others.  Even\r\nfriend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him eat,\r\nnever!  He throws no shadow, he make in the mirror no reflect, as\r\nagain Jonathan observe.  He has the strength of many of his hand,\r\nwitness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolves, and\r\nwhen he help him from the diligence too.  He can transform himself to\r\nwolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open\r\nthe dog, he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at\r\nWhitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as\r\nmy friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He can come in mist which he create, that noble ship''s captain proved\r\nhim of this, but, from what we know, the distance he can make this\r\nmist is limited, and it can only be round himself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust, as again Jonathan saw\r\nthose sisters in the castle of Dracula.  He become so small, we\r\nourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a\r\nhairbreadth space at the tomb door.  He can, when once he find his\r\nway, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it\r\nbe bound or even fused up with fire, solder you call it.  He can see\r\nin the dark, no small power this, in a world which is one half shut\r\nfrom the light.  Ah, but hear me through.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He can do all these things, yet he is not free.  Nay, he is even more\r\nprisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.\r\nHe cannot go where he lists, he who is not of nature has yet to obey\r\nsome of nature''s laws, why we know not.  He may not enter anywhere at\r\nthe first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to\r\ncome, though afterwards he can come as he please.  His power ceases,\r\nas does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Only at certain times can he have limited freedom.  If he be not at\r\nthe place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or\r\nat exact sunrise or sunset.  These things we are told, and in this\r\nrecord of ours we have proof by inference.  Thus, whereas he can do as\r\nhe will within his limit, when he have his earth-home, his\r\ncoffin-home, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he\r\nwent to the grave of the suicide at Whitby, still at other time he can\r\nonly change when the time come.  It is said, too, that he can only\r\npass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide.  Then there\r\nare things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic\r\nthat we know of, and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my\r\ncrucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is\r\nnothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent\r\nwith respect.  There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest\r\nin our seeking we may need them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from\r\nit, a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true\r\ndead, and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace,\r\nor the cut off head that giveth rest.  We have seen it with our eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine\r\nhim to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know.  But he is\r\nclever.  I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to\r\nmake his record, and from all the means that are, he tell me of what\r\nhe has been.  He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won\r\nhis name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier\r\nof Turkeyland.  If it be so, then was he no common man, for in that\r\ntime, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and\r\nthe most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ''land\r\nbeyond the forest.''  That mighty brain and that iron resolution went\r\nwith him to his grave, and are even now arrayed against us.  The\r\nDraculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and\r\nagain were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings\r\nwith the Evil One.  They learned his secrets in the Scholomance,\r\namongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims\r\nthe tenth scholar as his due.  In the records are such words as\r\n''stregoica'' witch, ''ordog'' and ''pokol'' Satan and hell, and in one\r\nmanuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as ''wampyr,'' which we all\r\nunderstand too well.  There have been from the loins of this very one\r\ngreat men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth where\r\nalone this foulness can dwell.  For it is not the least of its terrors\r\nthat this evil thing is rooted deep in all good, in soil barren of\r\nholy memories it cannot rest."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the\r\nwindow, and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room.  There\r\nwas a little pause, and then the Professor went on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And now we must settle what we do.  We have here much data, and we\r\nmust proceed to lay out our campaign.  We know from the inquiry of\r\nJonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all\r\nof which were delivered at Carfax, we also know that at least some of\r\nthese boxes have been removed.  It seems to me, that our first step\r\nshould be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond\r\nthat wall where we look today, or whether any more have been removed.\r\nIf the latter, we must trace&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere we were interrupted in a very startling way.  Outside the house\r\ncame the sound of a pistol shot, the glass of the window was shattered\r\nwith a bullet, which ricochetting from the top of the embrasure,\r\nstruck the far wall of the room.  I am afraid I am at heart a coward,\r\nfor I shrieked out.  The men all jumped to their feet, Lord Godalming\r\nflew over to the window and threw up the sash.  As he did so we heard\r\nMr. Morris'' voice without, "Sorry!  I fear I have alarmed you.  I\r\nshall come in and tell you about it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA minute later he came in and said, "It was an idiotic thing of me to\r\ndo, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most sincerely, I fear I must\r\nhave frightened you terribly.  But the fact is that whilst the\r\nProfessor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the window sill.\r\nI have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that\r\nI cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been\r\ndoing of late of evenings, whenever I have seen one.  You used to\r\nlaugh at me for it then, Art."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I don''t know, I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood."  Without\r\nsaying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume\r\nhis statement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We must trace each of these boxes, and when we are ready, we must\r\neither capture or kill this monster in his lair, or we must, so to\r\nspeak, sterilize the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.\r\nThus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours\r\nof noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most\r\nweak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.\r\nYou are too precious to us to have such risk.  When we part tonight,\r\nyou no more must question.  We shall tell you all in good time.  We\r\nare men and are able to bear, but you must be our star and our hope,\r\nand we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger,\r\nsuch as we are."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved, but it did not seem to me\r\ngood that they should brave danger and, perhaps lessen their safety,\r\nstrength being the best safety, through care of me, but their minds\r\nwere made up, and though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I\r\ncould say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Morris resumed the discussion, "As there is no time to lose, I\r\nvote we have a look at his house right now.  Time is everything with\r\nhim, and swift action on our part may save another victim."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so\r\nclose, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I\r\nappeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave\r\nme out of their counsels altogether.  They have now gone off to\r\nCarfax, with means to get into the house.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nManlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep, as if a woman can\r\nsleep when those she loves are in danger!  I shall lie down, and\r\npretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he\r\nreturns.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 October, 4 A.M.--Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent\r\nmessage was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at\r\nonce, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.  I\r\ntold the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the\r\nmorning, I was busy just at the moment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe attendant added, "He seems very importunate, sir.  I have never\r\nseen him so eager.  I don''t know but what, if you don''t see him soon,\r\nhe will have one of his violent fits."  I knew the man would not have\r\nsaid this without some cause, so I said, "All right, I''ll go now," and\r\nI asked the others to wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and\r\nsee my patient.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Take me with you, friend John," said the Professor.  "His case in your\r\ndiary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on our\r\ncase.  I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is\r\ndisturbed."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"May I come also?" asked Lord Godalming.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Me too?" said Quincey Morris.  "May I come?" said Harker.  I nodded,\r\nand we all went down the passage together.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more\r\nrational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him.  There was\r\nan unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had\r\never met with in a lunatic, and he took it for granted that his\r\nreasons would prevail with others entirely sane.  We all five went\r\ninto the room, but none of the others at first said anything.  His\r\nrequest was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send\r\nhim home.  This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete\r\nrecovery, and adduced his own existing sanity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I appeal to your friends," he said, "they will, perhaps, not mind\r\nsitting in judgement on my case.  By the way, you have not introduced\r\nme."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in\r\nan asylum did not strike me at the moment, and besides, there was a\r\ncertain dignity in the man''s manner, so much of the habit of equality,\r\nthat I at once made the introduction, "Lord Godalming, Professor Van\r\nHelsing, Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas, Mr. Jonathan Harker, Mr.\r\nRenfield."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe shook hands with each of them, saying in turn, "Lord Godalming, I\r\nhad the honour of seconding your father at the Windham; I grieve to\r\nknow, by your holding the title, that he is no more.  He was a man\r\nloved and honoured by all who knew him, and in his youth was, I have\r\nheard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much patronized on Derby\r\nnight.  Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great state.  Its\r\nreception into the Union was a precedent which may have far-reaching\r\neffects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to\r\nthe Stars and Stripes.  The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast\r\nengine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place\r\nas a political fable.  What shall any man say of his pleasure at\r\nmeeting Van Helsing?  Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of\r\nconventional prefix.  When an individual has revolutionized\r\ntherapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain\r\nmatter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to\r\nlimit him to one of a class.  You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by\r\nheredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold\r\nyour respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I\r\nam as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession\r\nof their liberties.  And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian\r\nand medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to\r\ndeal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional\r\ncircumstances."  He made this last appeal with a courtly air of\r\nconviction which was not without its own charm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think we were all staggered.  For my own part, I was under the\r\nconviction, despite my knowledge of the man''s character and history,\r\nthat his reason had been restored, and I felt under a strong impulse\r\nto tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about\r\nthe necessary formalities for his release in the morning.  I thought\r\nit better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of\r\nold I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was\r\nliable.  So I contented myself with making a general statement that he\r\nappeared to be improving very rapidly, that I would have a longer chat\r\nwith him in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the\r\ndirection of meeting his wishes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly, "But I fear, Dr.\r\nSeward, that you hardly apprehend my wish.  I desire to go at once,\r\nhere, now, this very hour, this very moment, if I may.  Time presses,\r\nand in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the\r\nessence of the contract.  I am sure it is only necessary to put before\r\nso admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momentous\r\na wish, to ensure its fulfilment."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to\r\nthe others, and scrutinized them closely.  Not meeting any sufficient\r\nresponse, he went on, "Is it possible that I have erred in my\r\nsupposition?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You have," I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly, "Then I\r\nsuppose I must only shift my ground of request.  Let me ask for this\r\nconcession, boon, privilege, what you will.  I am content to implore\r\nin such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others.  I\r\nam not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons, but you may, I\r\nassure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and\r\nunselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the\r\nsentiments which animate me.  Nay, more, you would count me amongst\r\nthe best and truest of your friends."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAgain he looked at us all keenly.  I had a growing conviction that\r\nthis sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet\r\nanother phase of his madness, and so determined to let him go on a\r\nlittle longer, knowing from experience that he would, like all\r\nlunatics, give himself away in the end.  Van Helsing was gazing at him\r\nwith a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting\r\nwith the fixed concentration of his look.  He said to Renfield in a\r\ntone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of\r\nit afterwards, for it was as of one addressing an equal, "Can you not\r\ntell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free tonight?  I will\r\nundertake that if you will satisfy even me, a stranger, without\r\nprejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind, Dr. Seward will\r\ngive you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the privilege\r\nyou seek."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on his\r\nface.  The Professor went on, "Come, sir, bethink yourself.  You claim\r\nthe privilege of reason in the highest degree, since you seek to\r\nimpress us with your complete reasonableness.  You do this, whose\r\nsanity we have reason to doubt, since you are not yet released from\r\nmedical treatment for this very defect.  If you will not help us in\r\nour effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty\r\nwhich you yourself put upon us?  Be wise, and help us, and if we can\r\nwe shall aid you to achieve your wish."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe still shook his head as he said, "Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to\r\nsay.  Your argument is complete, and if I were free to speak I should\r\nnot hesitate a moment, but I am not my own master in the matter.  I\r\ncan only ask you to trust me.  If I am refused, the responsibility\r\ndoes not rest with me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too\r\ncomically grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying, "Come, my\r\nfriends, we have work to do.  Goodnight."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient.\r\nHe moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he\r\nwas about to make another homicidal attack.  My fears, however, were\r\ngroundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his\r\npetition in a moving manner.  As he saw that the very excess of his\r\nemotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old\r\nrelations, he became still more demonstrative.  I glanced at Van\r\nHelsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes, so I became a\r\nlittle more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him\r\nthat his efforts were unavailing.  I had previously seen something of\r\nthe same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some\r\nrequest of which at the time he had thought much, such for instance,\r\nas when he wanted a cat, and I was prepared to see the collapse into\r\nthe same sullen acquiescence on this occasion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy expectation was not realized, for when he found that his appeal\r\nwould not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition.  He\r\nthrew himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them in\r\nplaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with\r\nthe tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form\r\nexpressive of the deepest emotion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out\r\nof this house at once.  Send me away how you will and where you will,\r\nsend keepers with me with whips and chains, let them take me in a\r\nstrait waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to gaol, but let me go\r\nout of this.  You don''t know what you do by keeping me here.  I am\r\nspeaking from the depths of my heart, of my very soul.  You don''t know\r\nwhom you wrong, or how, and I may not tell.  Woe is me!  I may not\r\ntell.  By all you hold sacred, by all you hold dear, by your love that\r\nis lost, by your hope that lives, for the sake of the Almighty, take\r\nme out of this and save my soul from guilt!  Can''t you hear me, man?\r\nCan''t you understand?  Will you never learn?  Don''t you know that I am\r\nsane and earnest now, that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane\r\nman fighting for his soul?  Oh, hear me!  Hear me!  Let me go, let me\r\ngo, let me go!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so\r\nwould bring on a fit, so I took him by the hand and raised him up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Come," I said sternly, "no more of this, we have had quite enough\r\nalready.  Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments.\r\nThen, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of\r\nthe bed.  The collapse had come, as on former occasions, just as I had\r\nexpected.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a\r\nquiet, well-bred voice, "You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the\r\njustice to bear in mind, later on, that I did what I could to convince\r\nyou tonight."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

I\r\nam so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.\r\nSomehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at\r\nall, but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy\r\nand brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such\r\na way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is\r\nfinished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us.  We were,\r\nI think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield.  When we\r\ncame away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward, "Say, Jack, if that man wasn''t\r\nattempting a bluff, he is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw.  I''m\r\nnot sure, but I believe that he had some serious purpose, and if he\r\nhad, it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added, "Friend\r\nJohn, you know more lunatics than I do, and I''m glad of it, for I fear\r\nthat if it had been to me to decide I would before that last\r\nhysterical outburst have given him free.  But we live and learn, and\r\nin our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would\r\nsay.  All is best as they are."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way, "I\r\ndon''t know but that I agree with you.  If that man had been an\r\nordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him, but he\r\nseems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am\r\nafraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads.  I can''t forget\r\nhow he prayed with almost equal fervor for a cat, and then tried to\r\ntear my throat out with his teeth.  Besides, he called the Count ''lord\r\nand master'', and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical\r\nway.  That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind\r\nto help him, so I suppose he isn''t above trying to use a respectable\r\nlunatic.  He certainly did seem earnest, though.  I only hope we have\r\ndone what is best.  These things, in conjunction with the wild work we\r\nhave in hand, help to unnerve a man."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said\r\nin his grave, kindly way, "Friend John, have no fear.  We are trying\r\nto do our duty in a very sad and terrible case, we can only do as we\r\ndeem best.  What else have we to hope for, except the pity of the good\r\nGod?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he\r\nreturned.  He held up a little silver whistle as he remarked, "That\r\nold place may be full of rats, and if so, I''ve got an antidote on\r\ncall."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHaving passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to\r\nkeep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone\r\nout.  When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took\r\nout a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four\r\nlittle groups, evidently one for each.  Then he spoke.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of\r\nmany kinds.  Our enemy is not merely spiritual.  Remember that he has\r\nthe strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our\r\nwindpipes are of the common kind, and therefore breakable or\r\ncrushable, his are not amenable to mere strength.  A stronger man, or\r\na body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold\r\nhim, but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him.  We must,\r\ntherefore, guard ourselves from his touch.  Keep this near your\r\nheart."  As he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it\r\nout to me, I being nearest to him, "put these flowers round your\r\nneck," here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms, "for\r\nother enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife, and for aid\r\nin all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your\r\nbreast, and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must\r\nnot desecrate needless."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and\r\nhanded to me.  Each of the others was similarly equipped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Now," he said, "friend John, where are the skeleton keys?  If so that\r\nwe can open the door, we need not break house by the window, as before\r\nat Miss Lucy''s."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as\r\na surgeon standing him in good stead.  Presently he got one to suit,\r\nafter a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and with a\r\nrusty clang, shot back.  We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges\r\ncreaked, and it slowly opened.  It was startlingly like the image\r\nconveyed to me in Dr. Seward''s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra''s\r\ntomb, I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with\r\none accord they shrank back.  The Professor was the first to move\r\nforward, and stepped into the open door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"In manus tuas, Domine!" he said, crossing himself as he passed over\r\nthe threshold.  We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have\r\nlit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road.  The\r\nProfessor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open\r\nit from within should we be in a hurry making our exit.  Then we all\r\nlit our lamps and proceeded on our search.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the\r\nrays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great\r\nshadows.  I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there\r\nwas someone else amongst us.  I suppose it was the recollection, so\r\npowerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that\r\nterrible experience in Transylvania.  I think the feeling was common\r\nto us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their\r\nshoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself\r\ndoing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe whole place was thick with dust.  The floor was seemingly inches\r\ndeep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding\r\ndown my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked.\r\nThe walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were\r\nmasses of spider''s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they\r\nlooked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down.\r\nOn a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed\r\nlabel on each.  They had been used several times, for on the table\r\nwere several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that\r\nexposed when the Professor lifted them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe turned to me and said, "You know this place, Jonathan.  You have\r\ncopied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do.  Which is\r\nthe way to the chapel?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not\r\nbeen able to get admission to it, so I led the way, and after a few\r\nwrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed\r\nwith iron bands.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"This is the spot," said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a\r\nsmall map of the house, copied from the file of my original\r\ncorrespondence regarding the purchase.  With a little trouble we found\r\nthe key on the bunch and opened the door.  We were prepared for some\r\nunpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous\r\nair seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected\r\nsuch an odour as we encountered.  None of the others had met the Count\r\nat all at close quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the\r\nfasting stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was bloated\r\nwith fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air, but here the\r\nplace was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air\r\nstagnant and foul.  There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma,\r\nwhich came through the fouler air.  But as to the odour itself, how\r\nshall I describe it?  It was not alone that it was composed of all the\r\nills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it\r\nseemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt.  Faugh!  It\r\nsickens me to think of it.  Every breath exhaled by that monster\r\nseemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our\r\nenterprise to an end, but this was no ordinary case, and the high and\r\nterrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which\r\nrose above merely physical considerations.  After the involuntary\r\nshrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set\r\nabout our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as\r\nwe began, "The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left,\r\nwe must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we\r\ncannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth\r\nchests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty!  Once I got a\r\nfright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the\r\nvaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an\r\ninstant my heart stood still.  Somewhere, looking out from the shadow,\r\nI seemed to see the high lights of the Count''s evil face, the ridge of\r\nthe nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor.  It was only\r\nfor a moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, "I thought I saw a face,\r\nbut it was only the shadows," and resumed his inquiry, I turned my\r\nlamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage.  There was no\r\nsign of anyone, and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of\r\nany kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no\r\nhiding place even for him.  I took it that fear had helped\r\nimagination, and said nothing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner,\r\nwhich he was examining.  We all followed his movements with our eyes,\r\nfor undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole\r\nmass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars.  We all\r\ninstinctively drew back.  The whole place was becoming alive with\r\nrats.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who\r\nwas seemingly prepared for such an emergency.  Rushing over to the\r\ngreat iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the\r\noutside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock,\r\ndrew the huge bolts, and swung the door open.  Then, taking his little\r\nsilver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call.  It was\r\nanswered from behind Dr. Seward''s house by the yelping of dogs, and\r\nafter about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of\r\nthe house.  Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we\r\nmoved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed.  The boxes\r\nwhich had been taken out had been brought this way.  But even in the\r\nminute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased.\r\nThey seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight,\r\nshining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made\r\nthe place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies.  The dogs\r\ndashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and\r\nthen, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most\r\nlugubrious fashion.  The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we\r\nmoved out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him\r\non the floor.  The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to\r\nrecover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies.  They fled\r\nbefore him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score,\r\nthe other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but\r\nsmall prey ere the whole mass had vanished.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for\r\nthe dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at\r\ntheir prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in\r\nthe air with vicious shakes.  We all seemed to find our spirits rise.\r\nWhether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening\r\nof the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding\r\nourselves in the open I know not, but most certainly the shadow of\r\ndread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our\r\ncoming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not\r\nslacken a whit in our resolution.  We closed the outer door and barred\r\nand locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the\r\nhouse.  We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary\r\nproportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had\r\nmade my first visit.  Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of\r\nuneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about\r\nas though they had been rabbit hunting in a summer wood.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.\r\nDr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall door from the bunch, and\r\nlocked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket\r\nwhen he had done.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"So far," he said, "our night has been eminently successful.  No harm\r\nhas come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained\r\nhow many boxes are missing.  More than all do I rejoice that this, our\r\nfirst, and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous, step has been\r\naccomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina\r\nor troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds\r\nand smells of horror which she might never forget.  One lesson, too,\r\nwe have learned, if it be allowable to argue a particulari, that the\r\nbrute beasts which are to the Count''s command are yet themselves not\r\namenable to his spiritual power, for look, these rats that would come\r\nto his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your\r\ngoing and to that poor mother''s cry, though they come to him, they run\r\npell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur.  We have other\r\nmatters before us, other dangers, other fears, and that monster&#8230;\r\nHe has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the\r\nlast time tonight.  So be it that he has gone elsewhere.  Good!  It\r\nhas given us opportunity to cry ''check'' in some ways in this chess\r\ngame, which we play for the stake of human souls.  And now let us go\r\nhome.  The dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content\r\nwith our first night''s work.  It may be ordained that we have many\r\nnights and days to follow, if full of peril, but we must go on, and\r\nfrom no danger shall we shrink."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who\r\nwas screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning\r\nsound from Renfield''s room.  The poor wretch was doubtless torturing\r\nhimself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of\r\npain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so\r\nsoftly that I had to put my ear down to hear it.  She looks paler than\r\nusual.  I hope the meeting tonight has not upset her.  I am truly\r\nthankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of\r\nour deliberations.  It is too great a strain for a woman to bear.  I\r\ndid not think so at first, but I know better now.  Therefore I am glad\r\nthat it is settled.  There may be things which would frighten her to\r\nhear, and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her\r\nif once she suspected that there was any concealment.  Henceforth our\r\nwork is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can\r\ntell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of\r\nthe nether world.  I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep\r\nsilence after such confidence as ours, but I must be resolute, and\r\ntomorrow I shall keep dark over tonight''s doings, and shall refuse to\r\nspeak of anything that has happened.  I rest on the sofa, so as not to\r\ndisturb her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 October, later.--I suppose it was natural that we should have all\r\noverslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no\r\nrest at all.  Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I\r\nslept till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call\r\ntwo or three times before she awoke.  Indeed, she was so sound asleep\r\nthat for a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with\r\na sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad\r\ndream.  She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest\r\ntill later in the day.  We now know of twenty-one boxes having been\r\nremoved, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals\r\nwe may be able to trace them all.  Such will, of course, immensely\r\nsimplify our labor, and the sooner the matter is attended to the\r\nbetter.  I shall look up Thomas Snelling today.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 October.--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor\r\nwalking into my room.  He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and\r\nit is quite evident that last night''s work has helped to take some of\r\nthe brooding weight off his mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said, "Your\r\npatient interests me much.  May it be that with you I visit him this\r\nmorning?  Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be.\r\nIt is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,\r\nand reason so sound."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go\r\nalone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting,\r\nso I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions.\r\nBefore the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any\r\nfalse impression from my patient.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But," he answered, "I want him to talk of himself and of his delusion\r\nas to consuming live things.  He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your\r\ndiary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief.  Why do you\r\nsmile, friend John?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here."  I laid my hand on the\r\ntypewritten matter.  "When our sane and learned lunatic made that very\r\nstatement of how he used to consume life, his mouth was actually\r\nnauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before\r\nMrs. Harker entered the room."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing smiled in turn.  "Good!" he said.  "Your memory is true,\r\nfriend John.  I should have remembered.  And yet it is this very\r\nobliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a\r\nfascinating study.  Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly\r\nof this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.  Who\r\nknows?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand.  It\r\nseemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van\r\nHelsing back in the study.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do I interrupt?" he asked politely as he stood at the door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Not at all," I answered.  "Come in.  My work is finished, and I am\r\nfree.  I can go with you now, if you like."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is needless, I have seen him!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I fear that he does not appraise me at much.  Our interview was\r\nshort.  When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the\r\ncentre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of\r\nsullen discontent.  I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with\r\nsuch a measure of respect as I could assume.  He made no reply\r\nwhatever.  ''Don''t you know me?'' I asked.  His answer was not\r\nreassuring: ''I know you well enough; you are the old fool Van\r\nHelsing.  I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain\r\ntheories somewhere else.  Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!''  Not a word\r\nmore would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent\r\nto me as though I had not been in the room at all.  Thus departed for\r\nthis time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic, so I\r\nshall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that\r\nsweet soul Madam Mina.  Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable\r\nthat she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our\r\nterrible things.  Though we shall much miss her help, it is better\r\nso."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I agree with you with all my heart," I answered earnestly, for I did\r\nnot want him to weaken in this matter.  "Mrs. Harker is better out of\r\nit.  Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who\r\nhave been in many tight places in our time, but it is no place for a\r\nwoman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in\r\ntime infallibly have wrecked her."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker, Quincey\r\nand Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth boxes.  I\r\nshall finish my round of work and we shall meet tonight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 October.--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am today,\r\nafter Jonathan''s full confidence for so many years, to see him\r\nmanifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all.\r\nThis morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though\r\nJonathan was late too, he was the earlier.  He spoke to me before he\r\nwent out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a\r\nword of what had happened in the visit to the Count''s house.  And yet\r\nhe must have known how terribly anxious I was.  Poor dear fellow!  I\r\nsuppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me.  They\r\nall agreed that it was best that I should not be drawn further into\r\nthis awful work, and I acquiesced.  But to think that he keeps\r\nanything from me!  And now I am crying like a silly fool, when I know\r\nit comes from my husband''s great love and from the good, good wishes\r\nof those other strong men.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat has done me good.  Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all.  And\r\nlest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept\r\nanything from him, I still keep my journal as usual.  Then if he has\r\nfeared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my\r\nheart put down for his dear eyes to read.  I feel strangely sad and\r\nlow-spirited today.  I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible\r\nexcitement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLast night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they\r\ntold me to.  I didn''t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring\r\nanxiety.  I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since\r\nJonathan came to see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible\r\ntragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end.\r\nEverything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring\r\non the very thing which is most to be deplored.  If I hadn''t gone to\r\nWhitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now.  She hadn''t taken\r\nto visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn''t come there\r\nin the day time with me she wouldn''t have walked in her sleep.  And if\r\nshe hadn''t gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn''t have\r\ndestroyed her as he did.  Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby?  There now,\r\ncrying again!  I wonder what has come over me today.  I must hide it\r\nfrom Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one\r\nmorning&#8230; I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has\r\nnever caused to shed a tear, the dear fellow would fret his heart out.\r\nI shall put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see\r\nit.  I suppose it is just one of the lessons that we poor women have\r\nto learn&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI can''t quite remember how I fell asleep last night.  I remember\r\nhearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like\r\npraying on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield''s room, which is\r\nsomewhere under this.  And then there was silence over everything,\r\nsilence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out\r\nof the window.  All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by\r\nthe moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own.  Not a\r\nthing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or\r\nfate, so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost\r\nimperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to\r\nhave a sentience and a vitality of its own.  I think that the\r\ndigression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back\r\nto bed I found a lethargy creeping over me.  I lay a while, but could\r\nnot quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again.  The\r\nmist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could\r\nsee it lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to\r\nthe windows.  The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could\r\nnot distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognize in his\r\ntones some passionate entreaty on his part.  Then there was the sound\r\nof a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him.\r\nI was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over\r\nmy head, putting my fingers in my ears.  I was not then a bit sleepy,\r\nat least so I thought, but I must have fallen asleep, for except\r\ndreams, I do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan\r\nwoke me.  I think that it took me an effort and a little time to\r\nrealize where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me.\r\nMy dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that\r\nwaking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back.  I\r\nwas very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act, my feet, and\r\nmy hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at\r\nthe usual pace.  And so I slept uneasily and thought.  Then it began\r\nto dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold.  I put\r\nback the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was\r\ndim around.  The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but\r\nturned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which\r\nhad evidently grown thicker and poured into the room.  Then it\r\noccurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed.  I\r\nwould have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden\r\nlethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will.  I lay still and\r\nendured, that was all.  I closed my eyes, but could still see through\r\nmy eyelids.  (It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how\r\nconveniently we can imagine.)  The mist grew thicker and thicker and I\r\ncould see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke, or with\r\nthe white energy of boiling water, pouring in, not through the window,\r\nbut through the joinings of the door.  It got thicker and thicker,\r\ntill it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of\r\ncloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of\r\nthe gas shining like a red eye.  Things began to whirl through my\r\nbrain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and\r\nthrough it all came the scriptural words "a pillar of cloud by day and\r\nof fire by night."  Was it indeed such spiritual guidance that was\r\ncoming to me in my sleep?  But the pillar was composed of both the day\r\nand the night guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the\r\nthought got a new fascination for me, till, as I looked, the fire\r\ndivided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes,\r\nsuch as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the\r\ncliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary''s Church.\r\nSuddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had\r\nseen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist\r\nin the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became\r\nblack darkness.  The last conscious effort which imagination made was\r\nto show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one''s reason if\r\nthere were too much of them.  I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr.\r\nSeward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only\r\nthat I fear to alarm them.  Such a dream at the present time would\r\nbecome woven into their fears for me.  Tonight I shall strive hard to\r\nsleep naturally.  If I do not, I shall tomorrow night get them to give\r\nme a dose of chloral, that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give\r\nme a good night''s sleep.  Last night tired me more than if I had not\r\nslept at all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 October 10 P.M.--Last night I slept, but did not dream.  I must have\r\nslept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed, but the\r\nsleep has not refreshed me, for today I feel terribly weak and\r\nspiritless.  I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down\r\ndozing.  In the afternoon, Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me.  Poor\r\nman, he was very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and\r\nbade God bless me.  Some way it affected me much.  I am crying when I\r\nthink of him.  This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful.\r\nJonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been crying.  He and the\r\nothers were out till dinner time, and they all came in tired.  I did\r\nwhat I could to brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me\r\ngood, for I forgot how tired I was.  After dinner they sent me to bed,\r\nand all went off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they\r\nwanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day.\r\nI could see from Jonathan''s manner that he had something important to\r\ncommunicate.  I was not so sleepy as I should have been, so before\r\nthey went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind,\r\nas I had not slept well the night before.  He very kindly made me up a\r\nsleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me\r\nno harm, as it was very mild&#8230; I have taken it, and am waiting for\r\nsleep, which still keeps aloof.  I hope I have not done wrong, for as\r\nsleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been\r\nfoolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking.  I might want\r\nit.  Here comes sleep.  Goodnight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor\r\nsoul, that he was only the assistant of Smollet, who of the two mates\r\nwas the responsible person.  So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr.\r\nJoseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out\r\nof a saucer.  He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good,\r\nreliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own.  He\r\nremembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful\r\ndog-eared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle\r\nabout the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries\r\nin thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the\r\nboxes.  There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from\r\nCarfax and left at 197 Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and\r\nanother six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey.  If then\r\nthe Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London,\r\nthese places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he\r\nmight distribute more fully.  The systematic manner in which this was\r\ndone made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two\r\nsides of London.  He was now fixed on the far east on the northern\r\nshore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south.  The north\r\nand west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical\r\nscheme, let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable\r\nLondon in the south-west and west.  I went back to Smollet, and asked\r\nhim if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe replied, "Well guv''nor, you''ve treated me very ''an''some", I had\r\ngiven him half a sovereign, "an I''ll tell yer all I know.  I heard a\r\nman by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the ''Are an'' ''Ounds,\r\nin Pincher''s Alley, as ''ow he an'' his mate ''ad ''ad a rare dusty job in\r\na old ''ouse at Purfleet.  There ain''t a many such jobs as this ''ere,\r\nan'' I''m thinkin'' that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI asked if he could tell me where to find him.  I told him that if he\r\ncould get me the address it would be worth another half sovereign to\r\nhim.  So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that\r\nhe was going to begin the search then and there.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt the door he stopped, and said, "Look ''ere, guv''nor, there ain''t no\r\nsense in me a keepin'' you ''ere.  I may find Sam soon, or I mayn''t, but\r\nanyhow he ain''t like to be in a way to tell ye much tonight.  Sam is a\r\nrare one when he starts on the booze.  If you can give me a envelope\r\nwith a stamp on it, and put yer address on it, I''ll find out where Sam\r\nis to be found and post it ye tonight.  But ye''d better be up arter\r\n''im soon in the mornin'', never mind the booze the night afore."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny\r\nto buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change.  When\r\nshe came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when\r\nSmollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found,\r\nI took my way to home.  We''re on the track anyhow.  I am tired\r\ntonight, and I want to sleep.  Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little\r\ntoo pale.  Her eyes look as though she had been crying.  Poor dear,\r\nI''ve no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her\r\ndoubly anxious about me and the others.  But it is best as it is.  It\r\nis better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to\r\nhave her nerve broken.  The doctors were quite right to insist on her\r\nbeing kept out of this dreadful business.  I must be firm, for on me\r\nthis particular burden of silence must rest.  I shall not ever enter\r\non the subject with her under any circumstances.  Indeed, It may not\r\nbe a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the\r\nsubject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we\r\ntold her of our decision.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 October, evening--A long and trying and exciting day.  By the first\r\npost I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed,\r\non which was written with a carpenter''s pencil in a sprawling hand,\r\n"Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4 Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth.  Arsk\r\nfor the depite."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina.  She looked\r\nheavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well.  I determined not to\r\nwake her, but that when I should return from this new search, I would\r\narrange for her going back to Exeter.  I think she would be happier in\r\nour own home, with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here\r\namongst us and in ignorance.  I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and\r\ntold him where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest\r\nso soon as I should have found out anything.  I drove to Walworth and\r\nfound, with some difficulty, Potter''s Court.  Mr. Smollet''s spelling\r\nmisled me, as I asked for Poter''s Court instead of Potter''s Court.\r\nHowever, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in\r\ndiscovering Corcoran''s lodging house.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I asked the man who came to the door for the "depite," he shook\r\nhis head, and said, "I dunno ''im.  There ain''t no such a person ''ere.\r\nI never ''eard of ''im in all my bloomin'' days.  Don''t believe there\r\nain''t nobody of that kind livin'' ''ere or anywheres."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI took out Smollet''s letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the\r\nlesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me.  "What\r\nare you?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I''m the depity," he answered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI saw at once that I was on the right track.  Phonetic spelling had\r\nagain misled me.  A half crown tip put the deputy''s knowledge at my\r\ndisposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains\r\nof his beer on the previous night at Corcoran''s, had left for his work\r\nat Poplar at five o''clock that morning.  He could not tell me where\r\nthe place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was\r\nsome kind of a "new-fangled ware''us," and with this slender clue I had\r\nto start for Poplar.  It was twelve o''clock before I got any\r\nsatisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee shop,\r\nwhere some workmen were having their dinner.  One of them suggested\r\nthat there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new "cold\r\nstorage" building, and as this suited the condition of a "new-fangled\r\nware''us," I at once drove to it.  An interview with a surly gatekeeper\r\nand a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the\r\nrealm, put me on the track of Bloxam.  He was sent for on my\r\nsuggestion that I was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman for\r\nthe privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter.  He\r\nwas a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing.  When I\r\nhad promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he\r\ntold me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in\r\nPiccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great\r\nboxes, "main heavy ones," with a horse and cart hired by him for this\r\npurpose.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly,\r\nto which he replied, "Well, guv''nor, I forgits the number, but it was\r\nonly a few door from a big white church, or somethink of the kind, not\r\nlong built.  It was a dusty old ''ouse, too, though nothin'' to the\r\ndustiness of the ''ouse we tooked the bloomin'' boxes from."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How did you get in if both houses were empty?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There was the old party what engaged me a waitin'' in the ''ouse at\r\nPurfleet.  He ''elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray.\r\nCurse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an'' him a old\r\nfeller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he\r\ncouldn''t throw a shadder."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHow this phrase thrilled through me!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Why, ''e took up ''is end o'' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and\r\nme a puffin'' an'' a blowin'' afore I could upend mine anyhow, an'' I''m no\r\nchicken, neither."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He was there too.  He must ''a started off and got there afore me, for\r\nwhen I rung of the bell he kem an'' opened the door ''isself an'' ''elped\r\nme carry the boxes into the ''all."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The whole nine?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yus, there was five in the first load an'' four in the second.  It was\r\nmain dry work, an'' I don''t so well remember ''ow I got ''ome."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI interrupted him, "Were the boxes left in the hall?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yus, it was a big ''all, an'' there was nothin'' else in it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI made one more attempt to further matters.  "You didn''t have any\r\nkey?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Never used no key nor nothink.  The old gent, he opened the door\r\n''isself an'' shut it again when I druv off.  I don''t remember the last\r\ntime, but that was the beer."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And you can''t remember the number of the house?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No, sir.  But ye needn''t have no difficulty about that.  It''s a ''igh\r\n''un with a stone front with a bow on it, an'' ''igh steps up to the\r\ndoor.  I know them steps, ''avin'' ''ad to carry the boxes up with three\r\nloafers what come round to earn a copper.  The old gent give them\r\nshillin''s, an'' they seein'' they got so much, they wanted more.  But ''e\r\ntook one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw ''im down the\r\nsteps, till the lot of them went away cussin''."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought that with this description I could find the house, so having\r\npaid my friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly.  I\r\nhad gained a new painful experience.  The Count could, it was evident,\r\nhandle the earth boxes himself.  If so, time was precious, for now\r\nthat he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by\r\nchoosing his own time, complete the task unobserved.  At Piccadilly\r\nCircus I discharged my cab, and walked westward.  Beyond the Junior\r\nConstitutional I came across the house described and was satisfied\r\nthat this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula.  The house\r\nlooked as though it had been long untenanted.  The windows were\r\nencrusted with dust, and the shutters were up.  All the framework was\r\nblack with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away.\r\nIt was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice board\r\nin front of the balcony.  It had, however, been roughly torn away, the\r\nuprights which had supported it still remaining.  Behind the rails of\r\nthe balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked\r\nwhite.  I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the\r\nnotice board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the\r\nownership of the house.  I remembered my experience of the investigation\r\nand purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find\r\nthe former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access\r\nto the house.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side,\r\nand nothing could be done, so I went around to the back to see if\r\nanything could be gathered from this quarter.  The mews were active,\r\nthe Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation.  I asked one or two\r\nof the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me\r\nanything about the empty house.  One of them said that he heard it had\r\nlately been taken, but he couldn''t say from whom.  He told me,\r\nhowever, that up to very lately there had been a notice board of "For\r\nSale" up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, &amp; Candy the house agents\r\ncould tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name\r\nof that firm on the board.  I did not wish to seem too eager, or to\r\nlet my informant know or guess too much, so thanking him in the usual\r\nmanner, I strolled away.  It was now growing dusk, and the autumn\r\nnight was closing in, so I did not lose any time.  Having learned the\r\naddress of Mitchell, Sons, &amp; Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I\r\nwas soon at their office in Sackville Street.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but\r\nuncommunicative in equal proportion.  Having once told me that the\r\nPiccadilly house, which throughout our interview he called a\r\n"mansion," was sold, he considered my business as concluded.  When I\r\nasked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and\r\npaused a few seconds before replying, "It is sold, sir."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Pardon me," I said, with equal politeness, "but I have a special\r\nreason for wishing to know who purchased it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAgain he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more.  "It is\r\nsold, sir," was again his laconic reply.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Surely," I said, "you do not mind letting me know so much."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But I do mind," he answered.  "The affairs of their clients are\r\nabsolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, &amp; Candy."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use\r\narguing with him.  I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so\r\nI said, "Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian\r\nof their confidence.  I am myself a professional man."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere I handed him my card.  "In this instance I am not prompted by\r\ncuriosity, I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know\r\nsomething of the property which was, he understood, lately for sale."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThese words put a different complexion on affairs.  He said, "I would\r\nlike to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would I like\r\nto oblige his lordship.  We once carried out a small matter of renting\r\nsome chambers for him when he was the honourable Arthur Holmwood.  If\r\nyou will let me have his lordship''s address I will consult the House\r\non the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his lordship\r\nby tonight''s post.  It will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate\r\nfrom our rules as to give the required information to his lordship."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked\r\nhim, gave the address at Dr. Seward''s and came away.  It was now dark,\r\nand I was tired and hungry.  I got a cup of tea at the Aerated Bread\r\nCompany and came down to Purfleet by the next train.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI found all the others at home.  Mina was looking tired and pale, but\r\nshe made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful.  It wrung my\r\nheart to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused\r\nher inquietude.  Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking\r\non at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our\r\nconfidence.  It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of\r\nkeeping her out of our grim task.  She seems somehow more reconciled,\r\nor else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for\r\nwhen any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders.  I am glad\r\nwe made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our\r\ngrowing knowledge would be torture to her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could not tell the others of the day''s discovery till we were alone,\r\nso after dinner, followed by a little music to save appearances even\r\namongst ourselves, I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.\r\nThe dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me\r\nas though she would detain me, but there was much to be talked of and\r\nI came away.  Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no\r\ndifference between us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire\r\nin the study.  In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply\r\nread it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of\r\nmy own information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I had finished Van Helsing said, "This has been a great day''s\r\nwork, friend Jonathan.  Doubtless we are on the track of the missing\r\nboxes.  If we find them all in that house, then our work is near the\r\nend.  But if there be some missing, we must search until we find them.\r\nThen shall we make our final coup, and hunt the wretch to his real\r\ndeath."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morris spoke, "Say!  How\r\nare we going to get into that house?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We got into the other," answered Lord Godalming quickly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But, Art, this is different.  We broke house at Carfax, but we had\r\nnight and a walled park to protect us.  It will be a mighty different\r\nthing to commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night.  I\r\nconfess I don''t see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck\r\ncan find us a key of some sort."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLord Godalming''s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the\r\nroom.  By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of\r\nus, "Quincey''s head is level.  This burglary business is getting\r\nserious.  We got off once all right, but we have now a rare job on\r\nhand.  Unless we can find the Count''s key basket."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at\r\nleast advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from\r\nMitchell''s, we decided not to take any active step before breakfast\r\ntime.  For a good while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in\r\nits various lights and bearings.  I took the opportunity of bringing\r\nthis diary right up to the moment.  I am very sleepy and shall go to\r\nbed&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust a line.  Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular.  Her\r\nforehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks\r\neven in her sleep.  She is still too pale, but does not look so\r\nhaggard as she did this morning.  Tomorrow will, I hope, mend all\r\nthis.  She will be herself at home in Exeter.  Oh, but I am sleepy!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 October.--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield.  His moods change so\r\nrapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they\r\nalways mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more\r\nthan interesting study.  This morning, when I went to see him after\r\nhis repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding\r\ndestiny.  He was, in fact, commanding destiny, subjectively.  He did\r\nnot really care for any of the things of mere earth, he was in the\r\nclouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor\r\nmortals.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked\r\nhim, "What about the flies these times?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way, such a smile as would\r\nhave become the face of Malvolio, as he answered me, "The fly, my dear\r\nsir, has one striking feature.  Its wings are typical of the aerial\r\npowers of the psychic faculties.  The ancients did well when they\r\ntypified the soul as a butterfly!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said\r\nquickly, "Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face\r\nas, shaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in\r\nhim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe said, "Oh, no, oh no!  I want no souls.  Life is all I want."  Here\r\nhe brightened up.  "I am pretty indifferent about it at present.  Life\r\nis all right.  I have all I want.  You must get a new patient, doctor,\r\nif you wish to study zoophagy!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis puzzled me a little, so I drew him on.  "Then you command life.\r\nYou are a god, I suppose?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe smiled with an ineffably benign superiority.  "Oh no!  Far be it\r\nfrom me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity.  I am not\r\neven concerned in His especially spiritual doings.  If I may state my\r\nintellectual position I am, so far as concerns things purely\r\nterrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied\r\nspiritually!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis was a poser to me.  I could not at the moment recall Enoch''s\r\nappositeness, so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by\r\nso doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic.  "And why\r\nwith Enoch?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Because he walked with God."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit it, so I harked\r\nback to what he had denied.  "So you don''t care about life and you\r\ndon''t want souls.  Why not?"  I put my question quickly and somewhat\r\nsternly, on purpose to disconcert him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe effort succeeded, for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into\r\nhis old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon\r\nme as he replied.  "I don''t want any souls, indeed, indeed!  I don''t.\r\nI couldn''t use them if I had them.  They would be no manner of use to\r\nme.  I couldn''t eat them or&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face,\r\nlike a wind sweep on the surface of the water.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And doctor, as to life, what is it after all?  When you''ve got all\r\nyou require, and you know that you will never want, that is all.  I\r\nhave friends, good friends, like you, Dr. Seward."  This was said with\r\na leer of inexpressible cunning.  "I know that I shall never lack the\r\nmeans of life!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some\r\nantagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such\r\nas he, a dogged silence.  After a short time I saw that for the\r\npresent it was useless to speak to him.  He was sulky, and so I came\r\naway.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater in the day he sent for me.  Ordinarily I would not have come\r\nwithout special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him\r\nthat I would gladly make an effort.  Besides, I am glad to have\r\nanything to help pass the time.  Harker is out, following up clues,\r\nand so are Lord Godalming and Quincey.  Van Helsing sits in my study\r\nporing over the record prepared by the Harkers.  He seems to think\r\nthat by accurate knowledge of all details he will light up on some\r\nclue.  He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause.  I\r\nwould have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought that\r\nafter his last repulse he might not care to go again.  There was also\r\nanother reason.  Renfield might not speak so freely before a third\r\nperson as when he and I were alone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI found him sitting in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose\r\nwhich is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part.  When\r\nI came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on\r\nhis lips.  "What about souls?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was evident then that my surmise had been correct.  Unconscious\r\ncerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic.  I determined\r\nto have the matter out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What about them yourself?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe did not reply for a moment but looked all around him, and up and\r\ndown, as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I don''t want any souls!" he said in a feeble, apologetic way.  The\r\nmatter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it, to\r\n"be cruel only to be kind."  So I said, "You like life, and you want\r\nlife?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh yes!  But that is all right.  You needn''t worry about that!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But," I asked, "how are we to get the life without getting the soul\r\nalso?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up, "A nice time you''ll\r\nhave some time when you''re flying out here, with the souls of\r\nthousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and\r\ntwittering and moaning all around you.  You''ve got their lives, you\r\nknow, and you must put up with their souls!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSomething seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to\r\nhis ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small\r\nboy does when his face is being soaped.  There was something pathetic\r\nin it that touched me.  It also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that\r\nbefore me was a child, only a child, though the features were worn,\r\nand the stubble on the jaws was white.  It was evident that he was\r\nundergoing some process of mental disturbance, and knowing how his\r\npast moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I\r\nthought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him, speaking\r\npretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears, "Would\r\nyou like some sugar to get your flies around again?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head.  With a laugh he\r\nreplied, "Not much!  Flies are poor things, after all!"  After a pause\r\nhe added, "But I don''t want their souls buzzing round me, all the\r\nsame."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Or spiders?" I went on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Blow spiders!  What''s the use of spiders?  There isn''t anything in\r\nthem to eat or&#8230;"  He stopped suddenly as though reminded of a\r\nforbidden topic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"So, so!" I thought to myself, "this is the second time he has\r\nsuddenly stopped at the word ''drink''.  What does it mean?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRenfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried\r\non, as though to distract my attention from it, "I don''t take any\r\nstock at all in such matters.  ''Rats and mice and such small deer,'' as\r\nShakespeare has it, ''chicken feed of the larder'' they might be called.\r\nI''m past all that sort of nonsense.  You might as well ask a man to\r\neat molecules with a pair of chopsticks, as to try to interest me\r\nabout the less carnivora, when I know of what is before me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I see," I said.  "You want big things that you can make your teeth\r\nmeet in?  How would you like to breakfast on an elephant?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What ridiculous nonsense you are talking?"  He was getting too wide\r\nawake, so I thought I would press him hard.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I wonder," I said reflectively, "what an elephant''s soul is like!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his\r\nhigh-horse and became a child again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I don''t want an elephant''s soul, or any soul at all!" he said.  For a\r\nfew moments he sat despondently.  Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with\r\nhis eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement.\r\n"To hell with you and your souls!" he shouted.  "Why do you plague me\r\nabout souls?  Haven''t I got enough to worry, and pain, to distract me\r\nalready, without thinking of souls?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal\r\nfit, so I blew my whistle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said\r\napologetically, "Forgive me, Doctor.  I forgot myself.  You do not\r\nneed any help.  I am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be\r\nirritable.  If you only knew the problem I have to face, and that I am\r\nworking out, you would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me.  Pray do not\r\nput me in a strait waistcoat.  I want to think and I cannot think\r\nfreely when my body is confined.  I am sure you will understand!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe had evidently self-control, so when the attendants came I told them\r\nnot to mind, and they withdrew.  Renfield watched them go.  When the\r\ndoor was closed he said with considerable dignity and sweetness, "Dr.\r\nSeward, you have been very considerate towards me.  Believe me that I\r\nam very, very grateful to you!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I came away.\r\nThere is certainly something to ponder over in this man''s state.\r\nSeveral points seem to make what the American interviewer calls "a\r\nstory," if one could only get them in proper order.  Here they are:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Will not mention "drinking."<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Fears the thought of being burdened with the "soul" of anything.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Has no dread of wanting "life" in the future.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads<br>\r\n    being haunted by their souls.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Logically all these things point one way!  He has assurance of<br>\r\n    some kind that he will acquire some higher life.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    He dreads the consequence, the burden of a soul.  Then it is a<br>\r\n    human life he looks to!<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    And the assurance&#8230;?<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMerciful God!  The Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme\r\nof terror afoot!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my\r\nsuspicion.  He grew very grave, and after thinking the matter over for\r\na while asked me to take him to Renfield.  I did so.  As we came to\r\nthe door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do\r\nin the time which now seems so long ago.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar\r\nas of old.  The flies, lethargic with the autumn, were beginning to\r\nbuzz into the room.  We tried to make him talk of the subject of our\r\nprevious conversation, but he would not attend.  He went on with his\r\nsinging, just as though we had not been present.  He had got a scrap\r\nof paper and was folding it into a notebook.  We had to come away as\r\nignorant as we went in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis is a curious case indeed.  We must watch him tonight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLETTER, MITCHELL, SONS &amp; CANDY TO LORD GODALMING.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"1 October.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My Lord,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes.

The\r\noriginal vendors are the executors of the late Mr. Archibald\r\nWinter-Suffield.

SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 October.--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to\r\nmake an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield''s room,\r\nand gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he\r\nwas to call me.  After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire\r\nin the study, Mrs. Harker having gone to bed, we discussed the\r\nattempts and discoveries of the day.  Harker was the only one who had\r\nany result, and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an\r\nimportant one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore going to bed I went round to the patient''s room and looked in\r\nthrough the observation trap.  He was sleeping soundly, his heart rose\r\nand fell with regular respiration.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after\r\nmidnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly.\r\nI asked him if that was all.  He replied that it was all he heard.\r\nThere was something about his manner, so suspicious that I asked him\r\npoint blank if he had been asleep.  He denied sleep, but admitted to\r\nhaving "dozed" for a while.  It is too bad that men cannot be trusted\r\nunless they are watched.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nToday Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are\r\nlooking after horses.  Godalming thinks that it will be well to have\r\nhorses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we\r\nseek there will be no time to lose.  We must sterilize all the\r\nimported earth between sunrise and sunset.  We shall thus catch the\r\nCount at his weakest, and without a refuge to fly to.  Van Helsing is\r\noff to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient\r\nmedicine.  The old physicians took account of things which their\r\nfollowers do not accept, and the Professor is searching for witch and\r\ndemon cures which may be useful to us later.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity\r\nin strait waistcoats.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--We have met again.  We seem at last to be on the track, and\r\nour work of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end.  I wonder if\r\nRenfield''s quiet has anything to do with this.  His moods have so\r\nfollowed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the\r\nmonster may be carried to him some subtle way.  If we could only get\r\nsome hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my\r\nargument with him today and his resumption of fly-catching, it might\r\nafford us a valuable clue.  He is now seemingly quiet for a spell&#8230;\r\nIs he?  That wild yell seemed to come from his room&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had\r\nsomehow met with some accident.  He had heard him yell, and when he\r\nwent to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with\r\nblood.  I must go at once&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3 October.--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well\r\nas I can remember, since last I made an entry.  Not a detail that I\r\ncan recall must be forgotten.  In all calmness I must proceed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I came to Renfield''s room I found him lying on the floor on his\r\nleft side in a glittering pool of blood.  When I went to move him, it\r\nbecame at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries.\r\nThere seemed none of the unity of purpose between the parts of the\r\nbody which marks even lethargic sanity.  As the face was exposed I\r\ncould see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten\r\nagainst the floor.  Indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool\r\nof blood originated.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned\r\nhim over, "I think, sir, his back is broken.  See, both his right arm\r\nand leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed."  How such a\r\nthing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure.  He\r\nseemed quite bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said, "I\r\ncan''t understand the two things.  He could mark his face like that by\r\nbeating his own head on the floor.  I saw a young woman do it once at\r\nthe Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her.  And I\r\nsuppose he might have broken his neck by falling out of bed, if he got\r\nin an awkward kink.  But for the life of me I can''t imagine how the\r\ntwo things occurred.  If his back was broke, he couldn''t beat his\r\nhead, and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there\r\nwould be marks of it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI said to him, "Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here\r\nat once.  I want him without an instant''s delay."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his\r\ndressing gown and slippers, appeared.  When he saw Renfield on the\r\nground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me.  I\r\nthink he recognized my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly,\r\nmanifestly for the ears of the attendant, "Ah, a sad accident!  He\r\nwill need very careful watching, and much attention.  I shall stay\r\nwith you myself, but I shall first dress myself.  If you will remain I\r\nshall in a few minutes join you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that\r\nhe had suffered some terrible injury.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a\r\nsurgical case.  He had evidently been thinking and had his mind made\r\nup, for almost before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me,\r\n"Send the attendant away.  We must be alone with him when he becomes\r\nconscious, after the operation."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI said, "I think that will do now, Simmons.  We have done all that we\r\ncan at present.  You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing\r\nwill operate.  Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual\r\nanywhere."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the\r\npatient.  The wounds of the face were superficial.  The real injury\r\nwas a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the\r\nmotor area.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor thought a moment and said, "We must reduce the pressure\r\nand get back to normal conditions, as far as can be.  The rapidity of\r\nthe suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury.  The whole\r\nmotor area seems affected.  The suffusion of the brain will increase\r\nquickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be too late."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door.  I went over\r\nand opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in\r\npajamas and slippers; the former spoke, "I heard your man call up Dr.\r\nVan Helsing and tell him of an accident.  So I woke Quincey or rather\r\ncalled for him as he was not asleep.  Things are moving too quickly\r\nand too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times.  I''ve\r\nbeen thinking that tomorrow night will not see things as they have\r\nbeen.  We''ll have to look back, and forward a little more than we have\r\ndone.  May we come in?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI nodded, and held the door open till they had entered, then I closed\r\nit again.  When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and\r\nnoted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly, "My God!  What\r\nhas happened to him?  Poor, poor devil!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI told him briefly, and added that we expected he would recover\r\nconsciousness after the operation, for a short time, at all events.\r\nHe went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming\r\nbeside him.  We all watched in patience.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We shall wait," said Van Helsing, "just long enough to fix the best\r\nspot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove\r\nthe blood clot, for it is evident that the haemorrhage is increasing."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness.  I\r\nhad a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing''s face I\r\ngathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to\r\ncome.  I dreaded the words Renfield might speak.  I was positively\r\nafraid to think.  But the conviction of what was coming was on me, as\r\nI have read of men who have heard the death watch.  The poor man''s\r\nbreathing came in uncertain gasps.  Each instant he seemed as though\r\nhe would open his eyes and speak, but then would follow a prolonged\r\nstertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more fixed\r\ninsensibility.  Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense\r\ngrew and grew upon me.  I could almost hear the beating of my own\r\nheart, and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows\r\nfrom a hammer.  The silence finally became agonizing.  I looked at my\r\ncompanions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and\r\ndamp brows that they were enduring equal torture.  There was a nervous\r\nsuspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal\r\nout powerfully when we should least expect it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\r\nsinking fast.  He might die at any moment.  I looked up at the\r\nProfessor and caught his eyes fixed on mine.  His face was sternly set\r\nas he spoke, "There is no time to lose.  His words may be worth many\r\nlives.  I have been thinking so, as I stood here.  It may be there is\r\na soul at stake!  We shall operate just above the ear."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWithout another word he made the operation.  For a few moments the\r\nbreathing continued to be stertorous.  Then there came a breath so\r\nprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.\r\nSuddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.\r\nThis was continued for a few moments, then it was softened into a glad\r\nsurprise, and from his lips came a sigh of relief.  He moved\r\nconvulsively, and as he did so, said, "I''ll be quiet, Doctor.  Tell\r\nthem to take off the strait waistcoat.  I have had a terrible dream,\r\nand it has left me so weak that I cannot move.  What''s wrong with my\r\nface?  It feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe tried to turn his head, but even with the effort his eyes seemed to\r\ngrow glassy again so I gently put it back.  Then Van Helsing said in a\r\nquiet grave tone, "Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs he heard the voice his face brightened, through its mutilation, and\r\nhe said, "That is Dr. Van Helsing.  How good it is of you to be here.\r\nGive me some water, my lips are dry, and I shall try to tell you.  I\r\ndreamed&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe stopped and seemed fainting.  I called quietly to Quincey, "The\r\nbrandy, it is in my study, quick!"  He flew and returned with a glass,\r\nthe decanter of brandy and a carafe of water.  We moistened the\r\nparched lips, and the patient quickly revived.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had been working in\r\nthe interval, for when he was quite conscious, he looked at me\r\npiercingly with an agonized confusion which I shall never forget, and\r\nsaid, "I must not deceive myself.  It was no dream, but all a grim\r\nreality."  Then his eyes roved round the room.  As they caught sight\r\nof the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went\r\non, "If I were not sure already, I would know from them."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor an instant his eyes closed, not with pain or sleep but\r\nvoluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear.\r\nWhen he opened them he said, hurriedly, and with more energy than he\r\nhad yet displayed, "Quick, Doctor, quick, I am dying!  I feel that I\r\nhave but a few minutes, and then I must go back to death, or worse!\r\nWet my lips with brandy again.  I have something that I must say\r\nbefore I die.  Or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow.  Thank\r\nyou!  It was that night after you left me, when I implored you to let\r\nme go away.  I couldn''t speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied.\r\nBut I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now.  I was in an\r\nagony of despair for a long time after you left me, it seemed hours.\r\nThen there came a sudden peace to me.  My brain seemed to become cool\r\nagain, and I realized where I was.  I heard the dogs bark behind our\r\nhouse, but not where He was!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs he spoke, Van Helsing''s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out\r\nand met mine and gripped it hard.  He did not, however, betray\r\nhimself.  He nodded slightly and said, "Go on," in a low voice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRenfield proceeded.  "He came up to the window in the mist, as I had\r\nseen him often before, but he was solid then, not a ghost, and his\r\neyes were fierce like a man''s when angry.  He was laughing with his\r\nred mouth, the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he\r\nturned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were\r\nbarking.  I wouldn''t ask him to come in at first, though I knew he\r\nwanted to, just as he had wanted all along.  Then he began promising\r\nme things, not in words but by doing them."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was interrupted by a word from the Professor, "How?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"By making them happen.  Just as he used to send in the flies when the\r\nsun was shining.  Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their\r\nwings.  And big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on\r\ntheir backs."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously, "The\r\nAcherontia Atropos of the Sphinges, what you call the ''Death''s-head\r\nMoth''?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe patient went on without stopping, "Then he began to whisper.  ''Rats,\r\nrats, rats!  Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a\r\nlife.  And dogs to eat them, and cats too.  All lives!  All red blood,\r\nwith years of life in it, and not merely buzzing flies!''  I laughed at\r\nhim, for I wanted to see what he could do.  Then the dogs howled, away\r\nbeyond the dark trees in His house.  He beckoned me to the window.  I\r\ngot up and looked out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call out\r\nwithout using any words.  A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on\r\nlike the shape of a flame of fire.  And then He moved the mist to the\r\nright and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with\r\ntheir eyes blazing red, like His only smaller.  He held up his hand,\r\nand they all stopped, and I thought he seemed to be saying, ''All these\r\nlives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through\r\ncountless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!''  And then a red\r\ncloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes, and\r\nbefore I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash and\r\nsaying to Him, ''Come in, Lord and Master!''  The rats were all gone, but\r\nHe slid into the room through the sash, though it was only open an\r\ninch wide, just as the Moon herself has often come in through the\r\ntiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again,\r\nand he continued, but it seemed as though his memory had gone on\r\nworking in the interval for his story was further advanced.  I was\r\nabout to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me,\r\n"Let him go on.  Do not interrupt him.  He cannot go back, and maybe\r\ncould not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe proceeded, "All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send\r\nme anything, not even a blowfly, and when the moon got up I was pretty\r\nangry with him.  When he did slide in through the window, though it\r\nwas shut, and did not even knock, I got mad with him.  He sneered at\r\nme, and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes\r\ngleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was\r\nno one.  He didn''t even smell the same as he went by me.  I couldn''t\r\nhold him.  I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had come into the\r\nroom."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind\r\nhim so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.\r\nThey were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered.  His\r\nface, however, grew grimmer and sterner still.  Renfield went on\r\nwithout noticing, "When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon\r\nshe wasn''t the same.  It was like tea after the teapot has been\r\nwatered."  Here we all moved, but no one said a word.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe went on, "I didn''t know that she was here till she spoke, and she\r\ndidn''t look the same.  I don''t care for the pale people.  I like them\r\nwith lots of blood in them, and hers all seemed to have run out.  I\r\ndidn''t think of it at the time, but when she went away I began to\r\nthink, and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out\r\nof her."  I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did; but we\r\nremained otherwise still.  "So when He came tonight I was ready for\r\nHim.  I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight.  I had heard\r\nthat madmen have unnatural strength.  And as I knew I was a madman, at\r\ntimes anyhow, I resolved to use my power.  Ay, and He felt it too, for\r\nHe had to come out of the mist to struggle with me.  I held tight, and\r\nI thought I was going to win, for I didn''t mean Him to take any more\r\nof her life, till I saw His eyes.  They burned into me, and my\r\nstrength became like water.  He slipped through it, and when I tried\r\nto cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down.  There was a red\r\ncloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to\r\nsteal away under the door."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous.  Van\r\nHelsing stood up instinctively.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We know the worst now," he said.  "He is here, and we know his\r\npurpose.  It may not be too late.  Let us be armed, the same as we\r\nwere the other night, but lose no time, there is not an instant to\r\nspare."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words, we\r\nshared them in common.  We all hurried and took from our rooms the\r\nsame things that we had when we entered the Count''s house.  The\r\nProfessor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he pointed to\r\nthem significantly as he said, "They never leave me, and they shall\r\nnot till this unhappy business is over.  Be wise also, my friends.  It\r\nis no common enemy that we deal with Alas!  Alas!  That dear Madam\r\nMina should suffer!"  He stopped, his voice was breaking, and I do not\r\nknow if rage or terror predominated in my own heart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOutside the Harkers'' door we paused.  Art and Quincey held back, and\r\nthe latter said, "Should we disturb her?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We must," said Van Helsing grimly.  "If the door be locked, I shall\r\nbreak it in."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"May it not frighten her terribly?  It is unusual to break into a\r\nlady''s room!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing said solemnly, "You are always right.  But this is life\r\nand death.  All chambers are alike to the doctor.  And even were they\r\nnot they are all as one to me tonight.  Friend John, when I turn the\r\nhandle, if the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and\r\nshove; and you too, my friends.  Now!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield.  We\r\nthrew ourselves against it.  With a crash it burst open, and we almost\r\nfell headlong into the room.  The Professor did actually fall, and I\r\nsaw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees.  What I\r\nsaw appalled me.  I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my\r\nneck, and my heart seemed to stand still.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the\r\nroom was light enough to see.  On the bed beside the window lay\r\nJonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a\r\nstupor.  Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the\r\nwhite-clad figure of his wife.  By her side stood a tall, thin man,\r\nclad in black.  His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we\r\nall recognized the Count, in every way, even to the scar on his\r\nforehead.  With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker''s hands,\r\nkeeping them away with her arms at full tension.  His right hand\r\ngripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his\r\nbosom.  Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream\r\ntrickled down the man''s bare chest which was shown by his torn-open\r\ndress.  The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child\r\nforcing a kitten''s nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink.\r\nAs we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish\r\nlook that I had heard described seemed to leap into it.  His eyes\r\nflamed red with devilish passion.  The great nostrils of the white\r\naquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge, and the white\r\nsharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood dripping mouth, clamped\r\ntogether like those of a wild beast.  With a wrench, which threw his\r\nvictim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and\r\nsprang at us.  But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and\r\nwas holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer.\r\nThe Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the\r\ntomb, and cowered back.  Further and further back he cowered, as we,\r\nlifting our crucifixes, advanced.  The moonlight suddenly failed, as a\r\ngreat black cloud sailed across the sky.  And when the gaslight sprang\r\nup under Quincey''s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour.  This, as\r\nwe looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its\r\nbursting open, had swung back to its old position.  Van Helsing, Art,\r\nand I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her\r\nbreath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so\r\ndespairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till\r\nmy dying day.  For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and\r\ndisarray.  Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated\r\nby the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin.  From her\r\nthroat trickled a thin stream of blood.  Her eyes were mad with\r\nterror.  Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which\r\nbore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count''s terrible grip, and\r\nfrom behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible\r\nscream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief.  Van\r\nHelsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body,\r\nwhilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran\r\nout of the room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing whispered to me, "Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know\r\nthe Vampire can produce.  We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a\r\nfew moments till she recovers herself.  I must wake him!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick\r\nhim on the face, his wife all the while holding her face between her\r\nhands and sobbing in a way that was heart breaking to hear.  I raised\r\nthe blind, and looked out of the window.  There was much moonshine,\r\nand as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and\r\nhide himself in the shadow of a great yew tree.  It puzzled me to\r\nthink why he was doing this.  But at the instant I heard Harker''s\r\nquick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to\r\nthe bed.  On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild\r\namazement.  He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full\r\nconsciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her\r\narms stretched out, as though to embrace him.  Instantly, however, she\r\ndrew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands\r\nbefore her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"In God''s name what does this mean?" Harker cried out.  "Dr. Seward,\r\nDr. Van Helsing, what is it?  What has happened?  What is wrong?  Mina,\r\ndear what is it?  What does that blood mean?  My God, my God!  Has it\r\ncome to this!"  And, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands\r\nwildly together.  "Good God help us!  Help her!  Oh, help her!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his\r\nclothes, all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion.\r\n"What has happened?  Tell me all about it!" he cried without pausing.\r\n"Dr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know.  Oh, do something to save her.\r\nIt cannot have gone too far yet.  Guard her while I look for him!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure\r\ndanger to him.  Instantly forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of\r\nhim and cried out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No!  No!  Jonathan, you must not leave me.  I have suffered enough\r\ntonight, God knows, without the dread of his harming you.  You must\r\nstay with me.  Stay with these friends who will watch over you!"  Her\r\nexpression became frantic as she spoke.  And, he yielding to her, she\r\npulled him down sitting on the bedside, and clung to him fiercely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing and I tried to calm them both.  The Professor held up his\r\ngolden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness, "Do not fear, my\r\ndear.  We are here, and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can\r\napproach.  You are safe for tonight, and we must be calm and take\r\ncounsel together."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husband''s\r\nbreast.  When she raised it, his white nightrobe was stained with\r\nblood where her lips had touched, and where the thin open wound in the\r\nneck had sent forth drops.  The instant she saw it she drew back, with\r\na low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Unclean, unclean!  I must touch him or kiss him no more.  Oh, that it\r\nshould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may\r\nhave most cause to fear."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo this he spoke out resolutely, "Nonsense, Mina.  It is a shame to me\r\nto hear such a word.  I would not hear it of you.  And I shall not\r\nhear it from you.  May God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with\r\nmore bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of\r\nmine anything ever come between us!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe put out his arms and folded her to his breast.  And for a while she\r\nlay there sobbing.  He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes\r\nthat blinked damply above his quivering nostrils.  His mouth was set\r\nas steel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then\r\nhe said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his\r\nnervous power to the utmost.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it.  Too well I know the broad\r\nfact.  Tell me all that has been."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI told him exactly what had happened and he listened with seeming\r\nimpassiveness, but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told\r\nhow the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible\r\nand horrid position, with her mouth to the open wound in his breast.\r\nIt interested me, even at that moment, to see that whilst the face of\r\nwhite set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands\r\ntenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair.  Just as I had\r\nfinished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.  They entered in\r\nobedience to our summons.  Van Helsing looked at me questioningly.  I\r\nunderstood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to\r\ndivert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from\r\neach other and from themselves.  So on nodding acquiescence to him he\r\nasked them what they had seen or done.  To which Lord Godalming\r\nanswered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms.\r\nI looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone.  He\r\nhad, however&#8230;"  He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping\r\nfigure on the bed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing said gravely, "Go on, friend Arthur.  We want here no more\r\nconcealments.  Our hope now is in knowing all.  Tell freely!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo Art went on, "He had been there, and though it could only have been\r\nfor a few seconds, he made rare hay of the place.  All the manuscript\r\nhad been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white\r\nashes.  The cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire,\r\nand the wax had helped the flames."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere I interrupted.  "Thank God there is the other copy in the safe!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on.  "I ran\r\ndownstairs then, but could see no sign of him.  I looked into\r\nRenfield''s room, but there was no trace there except&#8230;"  Again he\r\npaused.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Go on," said Harker hoarsely.  So he bowed his head and moistening his\r\nlips with his tongue, added, "except that the poor fellow is dead."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us she\r\nsaid solemnly, "God''s will be done!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could not but feel that Art was keeping back something.  But, as I\r\ntook it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing turned to Morris and asked, "And you, friend Quincey, have\r\nyou any to tell?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"A little," he answered.  "It may be much eventually, but at present I\r\ncan''t say.  I thought it well to know if possible where the Count\r\nwould go when he left the house.  I did not see him, but I saw a bat\r\nrise from Renfield''s window, and flap westward.  I expected to see him\r\nin some shape go back to Carfax, but he evidently sought some other\r\nlair.  He will not be back tonight, for the sky is reddening in the\r\neast, and the dawn is close.  We must work tomorrow!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe said the latter words through his shut teeth.  For a space of\r\nperhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that\r\nI could hear the sound of our hearts beating.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen Van Helsing said, placing his hand tenderly on Mrs. Harker''s\r\nhead, "And now, Madam Mina, poor dear, dear, Madam Mina, tell us\r\nexactly what happened.  God knows that I do not want that you be\r\npained, but it is need that we know all.  For now more than ever has\r\nall work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest.  The day\r\nis close to us that must end all, if it may be so, and now is the\r\nchance that we may live and learn."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe poor dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves\r\nas she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and\r\nlower still on his breast.  Then she raised her head proudly, and held\r\nout one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and after stooping and\r\nkissing it reverently, held it fast.  The other hand was locked in\r\nthat of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her\r\nprotectingly.  After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her\r\nthoughts, she began.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for\r\na long time it did not act.  I seemed to become more wakeful, and\r\nmyriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind.  All of\r\nthem connected with death, and vampires, with blood, and pain, and\r\ntrouble."  Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and\r\nsaid lovingly, "Do not fret, dear.  You must be brave and strong, and\r\nhelp me through the horrible task.  If you only knew what an effort it\r\nis to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand\r\nhow much I need your help.  Well, I saw I must try to help the\r\nmedicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I\r\nresolutely set myself to sleep.  Sure enough sleep must soon have come\r\nto me, for I remember no more.  Jonathan coming in had not waked me,\r\nfor he lay by my side when next I remember.  There was in the room the\r\nsame thin white mist that I had before noticed.  But I forget now if\r\nyou know of this.  You will find it in my diary which I shall show you\r\nlater.  I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and\r\nthe same sense of some presence.  I turned to wake Jonathan, but found\r\nthat he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken\r\nthe sleeping draught, and not I.  I tried, but I could not wake him.\r\nThis caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified.  Then\r\nindeed, my heart sank within me.  Beside the bed, as if he had stepped\r\nout of the mist, or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure,\r\nfor it had entirely disappeared, stood a tall, thin man, all in\r\nblack.  I knew him at once from the description of the others.  The\r\nwaxen face, the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin\r\nwhite line, the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing\r\nbetween, and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on\r\nthe windows of St. Mary''s Church at Whitby.  I knew, too, the red scar\r\non his forehead where Jonathan had struck him.  For an instant my\r\nheart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was\r\nparalyzed.  In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,\r\npointing as he spoke to Jonathan.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"''Silence!  If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains\r\nout before your very eyes.''  I was appalled and was too bewildered to\r\ndo or say anything.  With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my\r\nshoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying\r\nas he did so, ''First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions.\r\nYou may as well be quiet.  It is not the first time, or the second,\r\nthat your veins have appeased my thirst!''  I was bewildered, and\r\nstrangely enough, I did not want to hinder him.  I suppose it is a\r\npart of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his\r\nvictim.  And oh, my God, my God, pity me!  He placed his reeking lips\r\nupon my throat!"  Her husband groaned again.  She clasped his hand\r\nharder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the injured one,\r\nand went on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon.  How long\r\nthis horrible thing lasted I know not, but it seemed that a long time\r\nmust have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away.\r\nI saw it drip with the fresh blood!"  The remembrance seemed for a while\r\nto overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her\r\nhusband''s sustaining arm.  With a great effort she recovered herself\r\nand went on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then he spoke to me mockingly, ''And so you, like the others, would\r\nplay your brains against mine.  You would help these men to hunt me\r\nand frustrate me in my design!  You know now, and they know in part\r\nalready, and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my\r\npath.  They should have kept their energies for use closer to home.\r\nWhilst they played wits against me, against me who commanded nations,\r\nand intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before\r\nthey were born, I was countermining them.  And you, their best beloved\r\none, are now to me, flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, kin of my\r\nkin, my bountiful wine-press for a while, and shall be later on my\r\ncompanion and my helper.  You shall be avenged in turn, for not one of\r\nthem but shall minister to your needs.  But as yet you are to be\r\npunished for what you have done.  You have aided in thwarting me.  Now\r\nyou shall come to my call.  When my brain says "Come!" to you, you\r\nshall cross land or sea to do my bidding.  And to that end this!''\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"With that he pulled open his shirt, and with his long sharp nails\r\nopened a vein in his breast.  When the blood began to spurt out, he\r\ntook my hands in one of his, holding them tight, and with the other\r\nseized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound, so that I must\r\neither suffocate or swallow some to the&#8230; Oh, my God!  My God!\r\nWhat have I done?  What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have\r\ntried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days.  God pity\r\nme!  Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril.  And in\r\nmercy pity those to whom she is dear!"  Then she began to rub her lips\r\nas though to cleanse them from pollution.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to\r\nquicken, and everything became more and more clear.  Harker was still\r\nand quiet; but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a\r\ngrey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when\r\nthe first red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood\r\ndarkly out against the whitening hair.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy\r\npair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf this I am sure.  The sun rises today on no more miserable house in\r\nall the great round of its daily course.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

It\r\nis now six o''clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour\r\nand take something to eat, for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are\r\nagreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best.  Our best will\r\nbe, God knows, required today.  I must keep writing at every chance,\r\nfor I dare not stop to think.  All, big and little, must go down.\r\nPerhaps at the end the little things may teach us most.  The teaching,\r\nbig or little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we\r\nare today.  However, we must trust and hope.  Poor Mina told me just\r\nnow, with the tears running down her dear cheeks, that it is in\r\ntrouble and trial that our faith is tested.  That we must keep on\r\ntrusting, and that God will aid us up to the end.  The end!  Oh my\r\nGod!  What end?&#8230; To work!  To work!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor\r\nRenfield, we went gravely into what was to be done.  First, Dr. Seward\r\ntold us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room\r\nbelow they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap.  His\r\nface was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were\r\nbroken.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he\r\nhad heard anything.  He said that he had been sitting down, he\r\nconfessed to half dozing, when he heard loud voices in the room, and\r\nthen Renfield had called out loudly several times, "God!  God!  God!"\r\nAfter that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room\r\nhe found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had\r\nseen him.  Van Helsing asked if he had heard "voices" or "a voice,"\r\nand he said he could not say.  That at first it had seemed to him as\r\nif there were two, but as there was no one in the room it could have\r\nbeen only one.  He could swear to it, if required, that the word "God"\r\nwas spoken by the patient.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go\r\ninto the matter.  The question of an inquest had to be considered, and\r\nit would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe\r\nit.  As it was, he thought that on the attendant''s evidence he could\r\ngive a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed.  In\r\ncase the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest,\r\nnecessarily to the same result.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next\r\nstep, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full\r\nconfidence.  That nothing of any sort, no matter how painful, should\r\nbe kept from her.  She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was\r\npitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth\r\nof despair.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There must be no concealment," she said.  "Alas!  We have had too\r\nmuch already.  And besides there is nothing in all the world that can\r\ngive me more pain than I have already endured, than I suffer now!\r\nWhatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said,\r\nsuddenly but quietly, "But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid.  Not\r\nfor yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion\r\nof a martyr as she answered, "Ah no!  For my mind is made up!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"To what?" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still, for each in\r\nour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer answer came with direct simplicity, as though she was simply\r\nstating a fact, "Because if I find in myself, and I shall watch keenly\r\nfor it, a sign of harm to any that I love, I shall die!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You would not kill yourself?" he asked, hoarsely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I would.  If there were no friend who loved me, who would save me\r\nsuch a pain, and so desperate an effort!"  She looked at him meaningly\r\nas she spoke.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was sitting down, but now he rose and came close to her and put his\r\nhand on her head as he said solemnly.  "My child, there is such an one\r\nif it were for your good.  For myself I could hold it in my account\r\nwith God to find such an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it\r\nwere best.  Nay, were it safe!  But my child&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his throat.  He\r\ngulped it down and went on, "There are here some who would stand\r\nbetween you and death.  You must not die.  You must not die by any\r\nhand, but least of all your own.  Until the other, who has fouled your\r\nsweet life, is true dead you must not die.  For if he is still with\r\nthe quick Undead, your death would make you even as he is.  No, you\r\nmust live!  You must struggle and strive to live, though death would\r\nseem a boon unspeakable.  You must fight Death himself, though he come\r\nto you in pain or in joy.  By the day, or the night, in safety or in\r\nperil!  On your living soul I charge you that you do not die.  Nay,\r\nnor think of death, till this great evil be past."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe poor dear grew white as death, and shook and shivered, as I have\r\nseen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide.  We\r\nwere all silent.  We could do nothing.  At length she grew more calm\r\nand turning to him said sweetly, but oh so sorrowfully, as she held\r\nout her hand, "I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me\r\nlive, I shall strive to do so.  Till, if it may be in His good time,\r\nthis horror may have passed away from me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were\r\nstrengthened to work and endure for her, and we began to discuss what\r\nwe were to do.  I told her that she was to have all the papers in the\r\nsafe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter\r\nuse, and was to keep the record as she had done before.  She was\r\npleased with the prospect of anything to do, if "pleased" could be\r\nused in connection with so grim an interest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was\r\nprepared with an exact ordering of our work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is perhaps well," he said, "that at our meeting after our visit to\r\nCarfax we decided not to do anything with the earth boxes that lay\r\nthere.  Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and\r\nwould doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an\r\neffort with regard to the others.  But now he does not know our\r\nintentions.  Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such\r\na power exists to us as can sterilize his lairs, so that he cannot use\r\nthem as of old.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their\r\ndisposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may\r\ntrack the very last of them.  Today then, is ours, and in it rests our\r\nhope.  The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its\r\ncourse.  Until it sets tonight, that monster must retain whatever form\r\nhe now has.  He is confined within the limitations of his earthly\r\nenvelope.  He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks\r\nor chinks or crannies.  If he go through a doorway, he must open the\r\ndoor like a mortal.  And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs\r\nand sterilize them.  So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and\r\ndestroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the\r\ndestroying shall be, in time, sure."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that\r\nthe minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina''s life and\r\nhappiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was\r\nimpossible.  But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Nay, friend Jonathan," he said, "in this, the quickest way home is\r\nthe longest way, so your proverb say.  We shall all act and act with\r\ndesperate quick, when the time has come.  But think, in all probable\r\nthe key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.  The Count\r\nmay have many houses which he has bought.  Of them he will have deeds\r\nof purchase, keys and other things.  He will have paper that he write\r\non.  He will have his book of cheques.  There are many belongings that\r\nhe must have somewhere.  Why not in this place so central, so quiet,\r\nwhere he come and go by the front or the back at all hours, when in\r\nthe very vast of the traffic there is none to notice.  We shall go\r\nthere and search that house.  And when we learn what it holds, then we\r\ndo what our friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ''stop the\r\nearths'' and so we run down our old fox, so?  Is it not?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then let us come at once," I cried, "we are wasting the precious,\r\nprecious time!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor did not move, but simply said, "And how are we to get\r\ninto that house in Piccadilly?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Any way!" I cried.  "We shall break in if need be."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And your police?  Where will they be, and what will they say?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was staggered, but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good\r\nreason for it.  So I said, as quietly as I could, "Don''t wait more\r\nthan need be.  You know, I am sure, what torture I am in."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Ah, my child, that I do.  And indeed there is no wish of me to add to\r\nyour anguish.  But just think, what can we do, until all the world be\r\nat movement.  Then will come our time.  I have thought and thought,\r\nand it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all.  Now we\r\nwish to get into the house, but we have no key.  Is it not so?"  I\r\nnodded.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and\r\ncould not still get in.  And think there was to you no conscience of\r\nthe housebreaker, what would you do?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the\r\nlock for me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh no!  Not if they knew the man was properly employed."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then," he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, "all that is in doubt\r\nis the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as\r\nto whether or not that employer has a good conscience or a bad one.\r\nYour police must indeed be zealous men and clever, oh so clever, in\r\nreading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter.  No,\r\nno, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty\r\nhouses in this your London, or of any city in the world, and if you do\r\nit as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are\r\nrightly done, no one will interfere.  I have read of a gentleman who\r\nowned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer\r\nto Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar come and broke\r\nwindow at back and got in.  Then he went and made open the shutters in\r\nfront and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of\r\nthe police.  Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it,\r\nand put up big notice.  And when the day come he sell off by a great\r\nauctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them.  Then he go\r\nto a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he\r\npull it down and take all away within a certain time.  And your police\r\nand other authority help him all they can.  And when that owner come\r\nback from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where\r\nhis house had been.  This was all done en regle, and in our work we\r\nshall be en regle too.  We shall not go so early that the policemen\r\nwho have then little to think of, shall deem it strange.  But we shall\r\ngo after ten o''clock, when there are many about, and such things would\r\nbe done were we indeed owners of the house."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of\r\nMina''s face became relaxed in thought.  There was hope in such good\r\ncounsel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing went on, "When once within that house we may find more\r\nclues.  At any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find\r\nthe other places where there be more earth boxes, at Bermondsey and\r\nMile End."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLord Godalming stood up.  "I can be of some use here," he said.  "I\r\nshall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will\r\nbe most convenient."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Look here, old fellow," said Morris, "it is a capital idea to have\r\nall ready in case we want to go horse backing, but don''t you think\r\nthat one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a\r\nbyway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our\r\npurpose?  It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south\r\nor east.  And even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are\r\ngoing to."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Friend Quincey is right!" said the Professor.  "His head is what you\r\ncall in plane with the horizon.  It is a difficult thing that we go to\r\ndo, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see\r\nthat the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the\r\nterrible experience of the night.  She was very, very pale, almost\r\nghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth\r\nin somewhat of prominence.  I did not mention this last, lest it\r\nshould give her needless pain, but it made my blood run cold in my\r\nveins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had\r\nsucked her blood.  As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing\r\nsharper, but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of\r\nthe disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt.  It\r\nwas finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should\r\ndestroy the Count''s lair close at hand.  In case he should find it out\r\ntoo soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of\r\ndestruction.  And his presence in his purely material shape, and at\r\nhis weakest, might give us some new clue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,\r\nafter our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in\r\nPiccadilly.  That the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst\r\nLord Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End\r\nand destroyed them.  It was possible, if not likely, the Professor\r\nurged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and\r\nthat if so we might be able to cope with him then and there.  At any\r\nrate, we might be able to follow him in force.  To this plan I\r\nstrenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I said\r\nthat I intended to stay and protect Mina.  I thought that my mind was\r\nmade up on the subject, but Mina would not listen to my objection.  She\r\nsaid that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful.\r\nThat amongst the Count''s papers might be some clue which I could\r\nunderstand out of my experience in Transylvania.  And that, as it was,\r\nall the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Count''s\r\nextraordinary power.  I had to give in, for Mina''s resolution was\r\nfixed.  She said that it was the last hope for her that we should all\r\nwork together.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"As for me," she said, "I have no fear.  Things have been as bad as\r\nthey can be.  And whatever may happen must have in it some element of\r\nhope or comfort.  Go, my husband!  God can, if He wishes it, guard me\r\nas well alone as with any one present."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo I started up crying out, "Then in God''s name let us come at once,\r\nfor we are losing time.  The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than\r\nwe think."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Not so!" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But why?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do you forget," he said, with actually a smile, "that last night he\r\nbanqueted heavily, and will sleep late?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDid I forget!  Shall I ever&#8230; can I ever!  Can any of us ever\r\nforget that terrible scene!  Mina struggled hard to keep her brave\r\ncountenance, but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands\r\nbefore her face, and shuddered whilst she moaned.  Van Helsing had not\r\nintended to recall her frightful experience.  He had simply lost sight\r\nof her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his\r\nthoughtlessness and tried to comfort her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "dear, dear, Madam Mina, alas!  That I of\r\nall who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful.  These\r\nstupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so,\r\nbut you will forget it, will you not?"  He bent low beside her as he\r\nspoke.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said\r\nhoarsely, "No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember.\r\nAnd with it I have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take\r\nit all together.  Now, you must all be going soon.  Breakfast is\r\nready, and we must all eat that we may be strong."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBreakfast was a strange meal to us all.  We tried to be cheerful and\r\nencourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of\r\nus.  When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said, "Now, my dear\r\nfriends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise.  Are we all armed, as\r\nwe were on that night when first we visited our enemy''s lair.  Armed\r\nagainst ghostly as well as carnal attack?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe all assured him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then it is well.  Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case quite safe\r\nhere until the sunset.  And before then we shall return&#8230; if&#8230;\r\nWe shall return!  But before we go let me see you armed against personal\r\nattack.  I have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by\r\nthe placing of things of which we know, so that He may not enter.  Now\r\nlet me guard yourself.  On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred\r\nWafer in the name of the Father, the Son, and&#8230;"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear.  As\r\nhe had placed the Wafer on Mina''s forehead, it had seared it&#8230; had\r\nburned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal.\r\nMy poor darling''s brain had told her the significance of the fact as\r\nquickly as her nerves received the pain of it, and the two so\r\noverwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that\r\ndreadful scream.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut the words to her thought came quickly.  The echo of the scream had\r\nnot ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she\r\nsank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement.  Pulling her\r\nbeautiful hair over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she\r\nwailed out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Unclean!  Unclean!  Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh!  I\r\nmust bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgement\r\nDay."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey all paused.  I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of\r\nhelpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight.  For a few\r\nminutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around\r\nus turned away their eyes that ran tears silently.  Then Van Helsing\r\nturned and said gravely.  So gravely that I could not help feeling\r\nthat he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside\r\nhimself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see\r\nfit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgement Day, to redress all\r\nwrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon.\r\nAnd oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to\r\nsee, when that red scar, the sign of God''s knowledge of what has been,\r\nshall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know.\r\nFor so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees\r\nright to lift the burden that is hard upon us.  Till then we bear our\r\nCross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will.  It may be that we are\r\nchosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His\r\nbidding as that other through stripes and shame.  Through tears and\r\nblood.  Through doubts and fear, and all that makes the difference\r\nbetween God and man."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was hope in his words, and comfort.  And they made for\r\nresignation.  Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took\r\none of the old man''s hands and bent over and kissed it.  Then without\r\na word we all knelt down together, and all holding hands, swore to be\r\ntrue to each other.  We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of\r\nsorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved.  And\r\nwe prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before\r\nus.  It was then time to start.  So I said farewell to Mina, a parting\r\nwhich neither of us shall forget to our dying day, and we set out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo one thing I have made up my mind.  If we find out that Mina must be\r\na vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and\r\nterrible land alone.  I suppose it is thus that in old times one\r\nvampire meant many.  Just as their hideous bodies could only rest in\r\nsacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for\r\ntheir ghastly ranks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on\r\nthe first occasion.  It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic\r\nsurroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for\r\nsuch fear as already we knew.  Had not our minds been made up, and had\r\nthere not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have\r\nproceeded with our task.  We found no papers, or any sign of use in\r\nthe house.  And in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we\r\nhad seen them last.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before him, "And now,\r\nmy friends, we have a duty here to do.  We must sterilize this earth,\r\nso sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far distant\r\nland for such fell use.  He has chosen this earth because it has been\r\nholy.  Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more\r\nholy still.  It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it\r\nto God."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very\r\nsoon the top of one of the cases was thrown open.  The earth smelled\r\nmusty and close, but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our\r\nattention was concentrated on the Professor.  Taking from his box a\r\npiece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then\r\nshutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he\r\nworked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and\r\nleft them as we had found them to all appearance.  But in each was a\r\nportion of the Host.  When we closed the door behind us, the Professor\r\nsaid solemnly, "So much is already done.  It may be that with all the\r\nothers we can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may\r\nshine of Madam Mina''s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our\r\ntrain we could see the front of the asylum.  I looked eagerly, and in\r\nthe window of my own room saw Mina.  I waved my hand to her, and\r\nnodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished.  She\r\nnodded in reply to show that she understood.  The last I saw, she was\r\nwaving her hand in farewell.  It was with a heavy heart that we sought\r\nthe station and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we\r\nreached the platform.  I have written this in the train.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPiccadilly, 12:30 o''clock.--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street\r\nLord Godalming said to me, "Quincey and I will find a locksmith.  You\r\nhad better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty.\r\nFor under the circumstances it wouldn''t seem so bad for us to break\r\ninto an empty house.  But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law\r\nSociety might tell you that you should have known better."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went\r\non, "Besides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many\r\nof us.  My title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with\r\nany policeman that may come along.  You had better go with Jack and\r\nthe Professor and stay in the Green Park.  Somewhere in sight of the\r\nhouse, and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away,\r\ndo you all come across.  We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall\r\nlet you in."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The advice is good!" said Van Helsing, so we said no more.  Godalming\r\nand Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another.  At the\r\ncorner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into\r\nthe Green Park.  My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of\r\nour hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted\r\ncondition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours.  We\r\nsat down on a bench within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as\r\nto attract as little attention as possible.  The minutes seemed to\r\npass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt length we saw a four-wheeler drive up.  Out of it, in leisurely\r\nfashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris.  And down from the box\r\ndescended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools.\r\nMorris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away.  Together\r\nthe two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he\r\nwanted done.  The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on\r\none of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who\r\njust then sauntered along.  The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the\r\nman kneeling down placed his bag beside him.  After searching through\r\nit, he took out a selection of tools which he proceeded to lay beside\r\nhim in orderly fashion.  Then he stood up, looked in the keyhole, blew\r\ninto it, and turning to his employers, made some remark.  Lord\r\nGodalming smiled, and the man lifted a good sized bunch of keys.\r\nSelecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his\r\nway with it.  After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and\r\nthen a third.  All at once the door opened under a slight push from\r\nhim, and he and the two others entered the hall.  We sat still.  My\r\nown cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing''s went cold altogether.  We\r\nwaited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring his bag.\r\nThen he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst\r\nhe fitted a key to the lock.  This he finally handed to Lord\r\nGodalming, who took out his purse and gave him something.  The man\r\ntouched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed.  Not a\r\nsoul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked\r\nat the door.  It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom\r\nstood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The place smells so vilely," said the latter as we came in.  It did\r\nindeed smell vilely.  Like the old chapel at Carfax.  And with our\r\nprevious experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using\r\nthe place pretty freely.  We moved to explore the house, all keeping\r\ntogether in case of attack, for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy\r\nto deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not\r\nbe in the house.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the dining room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight\r\nboxes of earth.  Eight boxes only out of the nine which we sought!\r\nOur work was not over, and would never be until we should have found\r\nthe missing box.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFirst we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a\r\nnarrow stone flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to\r\nlook like the front of a miniature house.  There were no windows in\r\nit, so we were not afraid of being overlooked.  We did not lose any\r\ntime in examining the chests.  With the tools which we had brought\r\nwith us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated\r\nthose others in the old chapel.  It was evident to us that the Count\r\nwas not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of\r\nhis effects.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to\r\nattic, we came to the conclusion that the dining room contained any\r\neffects which might belong to the Count.  And so we proceeded to\r\nminutely examine them.  They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the\r\ngreat dining room table.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle,\r\ndeeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey,\r\nnotepaper, envelopes, and pens and ink.  All were covered up in thin\r\nwrapping paper to keep them from the dust.  There were also a clothes\r\nbrush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin.  The latter containing\r\ndirty water which was reddened as if with blood.  Last of all was a\r\nlittle heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging\r\nto the other houses.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris\r\ntaking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the\r\nEast and the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set\r\nout to destroy the boxes in these places.  The rest of us are, with\r\nwhat patience we can, waiting their return, or the coming of the\r\nCount.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3 October.--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for\r\nthe coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris.  The Professor tried to\r\nkeep our minds active by using them all the time.  I could see his\r\nbeneficent purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to\r\ntime at Harker.  The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is\r\nappalling to see.  Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with\r\nstrong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair.\r\nToday he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well\r\nwith the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face.  His\r\nenergy is still intact.  In fact, he is like a living flame.  This may\r\nyet be his salvation, for if all go well, it will tide him over the\r\ndespairing period.  He will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the\r\nrealities of life.  Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad\r\nenough, but his&#8230; !\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep\r\nhis mind active.  What he has been saying was, under the\r\ncircumstances, of absorbing interest.  So well as I can remember, here\r\nit is:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands,\r\nall the papers relating to this monster, and the more I have studied,\r\nthe greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out.  All through\r\nthere are signs of his advance.  Not only of his power, but of his\r\nknowledge of it.  As I learned from the researches of my friend\r\nArminius of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man.  Soldier,\r\nstatesman, and alchemist--which latter was the highest development of\r\nthe science knowledge of his time.  He had a mighty brain, a learning\r\nbeyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse.  He\r\ndared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of\r\nknowledge of his time that he did not essay.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death.  Though it\r\nwould seem that memory was not all complete.  In some faculties of\r\nmind he has been, and is, only a child.  But he is growing, and some\r\nthings that were childish at the first are now of man''s stature.  He\r\nis experimenting, and doing it well.  And if it had not been that we\r\nhave crossed his path he would be yet, he may be yet if we fail, the\r\nfather or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead\r\nthrough Death, not Life."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHarker groaned and said, "And this is all arrayed against my darling!\r\nBut how is he experimenting?  The knowledge may help us to defeat\r\nhim!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but\r\nsurely.  That big child-brain of his is working.  Well for us, it is\r\nas yet a child-brain.  For had he dared, at the first, to attempt\r\ncertain things he would long ago have been beyond our power.  However,\r\nhe means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford\r\nto wait and to go slow.  Festina lente may well be his motto."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I fail to understand," said Harker wearily.  "Oh, do be more plain to\r\nme!  Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke, "Ah,\r\nmy child, I will be plain.  Do you not see how, of late, this monster\r\nhas been creeping into knowledge experimentally.  How he has been\r\nmaking use of the zoophagous patient to effect his entry into friend\r\nJohn''s home.  For your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come\r\nwhen and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked\r\nthereto by an inmate.  But these are not his most important\r\nexperiments.  Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes\r\nwere moved by others.  He knew not then but that must be so.  But all\r\nthe time that so great child-brain of his was growing, and he began to\r\nconsider whether he might not himself move the box.  So he began to\r\nhelp.  And then, when he found that this be all right, he try to move\r\nthem all alone.  And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of\r\nhim.  And none but he know where they are hidden.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground.  So that only he\r\nuse them in the night, or at such time as he can change his form, they\r\ndo him equal well, and none may know these are his hiding place!  But,\r\nmy child, do not despair, this knowledge came to him just too late!\r\nAlready all of his lairs but one be sterilize as for him.  And before\r\nthe sunset this shall be so.  Then he have no place where he can move\r\nand hide.  I delayed this morning that so we might be sure.  Is there\r\nnot more at stake for us than for him?  Then why not be more careful\r\nthan him?  By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well,\r\nfriend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us.  Today is our day,\r\nand we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance.  See!  There are\r\nfive of us when those absent ones return."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhilst we were speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door,\r\nthe double postman''s knock of the telegraph boy.  We all moved out to\r\nthe hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us\r\nto keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it.  The boy handed in\r\na dispatch.  The Professor closed the door again, and after looking at\r\nthe direction, opened it and read aloud.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Look out for D.  He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax\r\nhurriedly and hastened towards the South.  He seems to be\r\ngoing the round and may want to see you:  Mina."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker''s voice, "Now, God be\r\nthanked, we shall soon meet!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing turned to him quickly and said, "God will act in His own\r\nway and time.  Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet.  For what we\r\nwish for at the moment may be our own undoings."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I care for nothing now," he answered hotly, "except to wipe out this\r\nbrute from the face of creation.  I would sell my soul to do it!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, hush, hush, my child!" said Van Helsing.  "God does not purchase\r\nsouls in this wise, and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not\r\nkeep faith.  But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and\r\nyour devotion to that dear Madam Mina.  Think you, how her pain would\r\nbe doubled, did she but hear your wild words.  Do not fear any of us,\r\nwe are all devoted to this cause, and today shall see the end.  The\r\ntime is coming for action.  Today this Vampire is limit to the powers\r\nof man, and till sunset he may not change.  It will take him time to\r\narrive here, see it is twenty minutes past one, and there are yet some\r\ntimes before he can hither come, be he never so quick.  What we must\r\nhope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAbout half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker''s telegram, there\r\ncame a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door.  It was just an\r\nordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but\r\nit made the Professor''s heart and mine beat loudly.  We looked at each\r\nother, and together moved out into the hall.  We each held ready to\r\nuse our various armaments, the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal\r\nin the right.  Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and holding the door\r\nhalf open, stood back, having both hands ready for action.  The\r\ngladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the\r\nstep, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris.\r\nThey came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former\r\nsaying, as they moved along the hall:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It is all right.  We found both places.  Six boxes in each and we\r\ndestroyed them all."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Destroyed?" asked the Professor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"For him!"  We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said,\r\n"There''s nothing to do but to wait here.  If, however, he doesn''t turn\r\nup by five o''clock, we must start off.  For it won''t do to leave Mrs.\r\nHarker alone after sunset."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He will be here before long now," said Van Helsing, who had been\r\nconsulting his pocketbook.  "Nota bene, in Madam''s telegram he went\r\nsouth from Carfax.  That means he went to cross the river, and he\r\ncould only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before\r\none o''clock.  That he went south has a meaning for us.  He is as yet\r\nonly suspicious, and he went from Carfax first to the place where he\r\nwould suspect interference least.  You must have been at Bermondsey\r\nonly a short time before him.  That he is not here already shows that\r\nhe went to Mile End next.  This took him some time, for he would then\r\nhave to be carried over the river in some way.  Believe me, my\r\nfriends, we shall not have long to wait now.  We should have ready\r\nsome plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance.  Hush, there\r\nis no time now.  Have all your arms!  Be ready!"  He held up a warning\r\nhand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the\r\nlock of the hall door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a\r\ndominant spirit asserted itself.  In all our hunting parties and\r\nadventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always\r\nbeen the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been\r\naccustomed to obey him implicitly.  Now, the old habit seemed to be\r\nrenewed instinctively.  With a swift glance around the room, he at\r\nonce laid out our plan of attack, and without speaking a word, with a\r\ngesture, placed us each in position.  Van Helsing, Harker, and I were\r\njust behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could\r\nguard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.\r\nGodalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to\r\nmove in front of the window.  We waited in a suspense that made the\r\nseconds pass with nightmare slowness.  The slow, careful steps came\r\nalong the hall.  The Count was evidently prepared for some surprise,\r\nat least he feared it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room.  Winning a way\r\npast us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him.  There was\r\nsomething so pantherlike in the movement, something so unhuman, that\r\nit seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming.  The first to\r\nact was Harker, who with a quick movement, threw himself before the\r\ndoor leading into the room in the front of the house.  As the Count\r\nsaw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the\r\neyeteeth long and pointed.  But the evil smile as quickly passed into\r\na cold stare of lion-like disdain.  His expression again changed as,\r\nwith a single impulse, we all advanced upon him.  It was a pity that\r\nwe had not some better organized plan of attack, for even at the\r\nmoment I wondered what we were to do.  I did not myself know whether\r\nour lethal weapons would avail us anything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHarker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great\r\nKukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him.  The blow was a\r\npowerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count''s leap back\r\nsaved him.  A second less and the trenchant blade had shorn through\r\nhis heart.  As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,\r\nmaking a wide gap whence a bundle of bank notes and a stream\r\nof gold fell out.  The expression of the Count''s face was so hellish,\r\nthat for a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the\r\nterrible knife aloft again for another stroke.  Instinctively I moved\r\nforward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in\r\nmy left hand.  I felt a mighty power fly along my arm, and it was\r\nwithout surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar\r\nmovement made spontaneously by each one of us.  It would be impossible\r\nto describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity, of anger and\r\nhellish rage, which came over the Count''s face.  His waxen hue became\r\ngreenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar\r\non the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound.\r\nThe next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker''s arm, ere\r\nhis blow could fall, and grasping a handful of the money from the\r\nfloor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window.  Amid the\r\ncrash and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into the flagged\r\narea below.  Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the\r\n"ting" of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground.  He, rushing up\r\nthe steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.\r\nThere he turned and spoke to us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You think to baffle me, you with your pale faces all in a row, like\r\nsheep in a butcher''s.  You shall be sorry yet, each one of you!  You\r\nthink you have left me without a place to rest, but I have more.  My\r\nrevenge is just begun!  I spread it over centuries, and time is on my\r\nside.  Your girls that you all love are mine already.  And through\r\nthem you and others shall yet be mine, my creatures, to do my bidding\r\nand to be my jackals when I want to feed.  Bah!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly through the door, and we\r\nheard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him.  A door\r\nbeyond opened and shut.  The first of us to speak was the Professor.\r\nRealizing the difficulty of following him through the stable, we moved\r\ntoward the hall.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We have learnt something&#8230; much!  Notwithstanding his brave words,\r\nhe fears us.  He fears time, he fears want!  For if not, why he hurry\r\nso?  His very tone betray him, or my ears deceive.  Why take that\r\nmoney?  You follow quick.  You are hunters of the wild beast, and\r\nunderstand it so.  For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use\r\nto him, if so that he returns."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs he spoke he put the money remaining in his pocket, took the title\r\ndeeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the remaining\r\nthings into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with a\r\nmatch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGodalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had\r\nlowered himself from the window to follow the Count.  He had, however,\r\nbolted the stable door, and by the time they had forced it open there\r\nwas no sign of him.  Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the\r\nback of the house.  But the mews was deserted and no one had seen him\r\ndepart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off.  We had\r\nto recognize that our game was up.  With heavy hearts we agreed with\r\nthe Professor when he said, "Let us go back to Madam Mina.  Poor, poor\r\ndear Madam Mina.  All we can do just now is done, and we can there, at\r\nleast, protect her.  But we need not despair.  There is but one more\r\nearth box, and we must try to find it.  When that is done all may yet\r\nbe well."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker.\r\nThe poor fellow was quite broken down, now and again he gave a low\r\ngroan which he could not suppress.  He was thinking of his wife.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker\r\nwaiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her\r\nbravery and unselfishness.  When she saw our faces, her own became as\r\npale as death.  For a second or two her eyes were closed as if she\r\nwere in secret prayer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then she said cheerfully, "I can never thank you all enough.  Oh,\r\nmy poor darling!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs she spoke, she took her husband''s grey head in her hands and kissed\r\nit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Lay your poor head here and rest it.  All will yet be well, dear!  God\r\nwill protect us if He so will it in His good intent."  The poor fellow\r\ngroaned.  There was no place for words in his sublime misery.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered\r\nus all up somewhat.  It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to\r\nhungry people, for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast, or\r\nthe sense of companionship may have helped us, but anyhow we were all\r\nless miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTrue to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed.\r\nAnd although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to\r\nthreaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was\r\nmanifested, she listened bravely and with calmness.  When we came to\r\nthe part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung\r\nto her husband''s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could\r\nprotect him from any harm that might come.  She said nothing, however,\r\ntill the narration was all done, and matters had been brought up to\r\nthe present time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen without letting go her husband''s hand she stood up amongst us and\r\nspoke.  Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene.  Of that sweet,\r\nsweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and\r\nanimation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which she was\r\nconscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth, remembering\r\nwhence and how it came.  Her loving kindness against our grim hate.\r\nHer tender faith against all our fears and doubting.  And we, knowing\r\nthat so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and purity and\r\nfaith, was outcast from God.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Jonathan," she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it\r\nwas so full of love and tenderness, "Jonathan dear, and you all my\r\ntrue, true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all\r\nthis dreadful time.  I know that you must fight.  That you must\r\ndestroy even as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy\r\nmight live hereafter.  But it is not a work of hate.  That poor soul\r\nwho has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all.  Just\r\nthink what will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worser\r\npart that his better part may have spiritual immortality.  You must be\r\npitiful to him, too, though it may not hold your hands from his\r\ndestruction."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs she spoke I could see her husband''s face darken and draw together,\r\nas though the passion in him were shriveling his being to its core.\r\nInstinctively the clasp on his wife''s hand grew closer, till his\r\nknuckles looked white.  She did not flinch from the pain which I knew\r\nshe must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more\r\nappealing than ever.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing his hand\r\nfrom hers as he spoke.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that\r\nearthly life of him which we are aiming at.  If beyond it I could send\r\nhis soul forever and ever to burning hell I would do it!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, hush!  Oh, hush in the name of the good God.  Don''t say such\r\nthings, Jonathan, my husband, or you will crush me with fear and\r\nhorror.  Just think, my dear&#8230; I have been thinking all this long,\r\nlong day of it&#8230; that&#8230; perhaps&#8230; some day&#8230; I, too, may\r\nneed such pity, and that some other like you, and with equal cause for\r\nanger, may deny it to me!  Oh, my husband!  My husband, indeed I would\r\nhave spared you such a thought had there been another way.  But I pray\r\nthat God may not have treasured your wild words, except as the\r\nheart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man.  Oh, God,\r\nlet these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered, who\r\nall his life has done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have\r\ncome."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe men were all in tears now.  There was no resisting them, and we\r\nwept openly.  She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had\r\nprevailed.  Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and\r\nputting his arms round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress.\r\nVan Helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the\r\ntwo loving hearts alone with their God.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming\r\nof the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.\r\nShe tried to school herself to the belief, and manifestly for her\r\nhusband''s sake, tried to seem content.  It was a brave struggle, and\r\nwas, I think and believe, not without its reward.  Van Helsing had\r\nplaced at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any\r\nemergency.  When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged\r\nthat we should sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over\r\nthe safety of the poor stricken lady.  The first watch falls to\r\nQuincey, so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGodalming has already turned in, for his is the second watch.  Now\r\nthat my work is done I, too, shall go to bed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3-4 October, close to midnight.--I thought yesterday would never end.\r\nThere was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief\r\nthat to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must\r\nnow be for the better.  Before we parted, we discussed what our next\r\nstep was to be, but we could arrive at no result.  All we knew was\r\nthat one earth box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it\r\nwas.  If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years.  And in\r\nthe meantime, the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even\r\nnow.  This I know, that if ever there was a woman who was all\r\nperfection, that one is my poor wronged darling.  I loved her a\r\nthousand times more for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made\r\nmy own hate of the monster seem despicable.  Surely God will not\r\npermit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature.  This\r\nis hope to me.  We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our\r\nonly anchor.  Thank God!  Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without\r\ndreams.  I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible\r\nmemories to ground them in.  She has not been so calm, within my\r\nseeing, since the sunset.  Then, for a while, there came over her face\r\na repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.  I thought\r\nat the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face,\r\nbut somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning.  I am not sleepy\r\nmyself, though I am weary&#8230; weary to death.  However, I must try\r\nto sleep.  For there is tomorrow to think of, and there is no rest for\r\nme until&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awakened by Mina, who was\r\nsitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face.  I could see\r\neasily, for we did not leave the room in darkness.  She had placed a\r\nwarning hand over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear, "Hush!\r\nThere is someone in the corridor!"  I got up softly, and crossing the\r\nroom, gently opened the door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake.  He\r\nraised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me, "Hush!  Go\r\nback to bed.  It is all right.  One of us will be here all night.  We\r\ndon''t mean to take any chances!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.\r\nShe sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor,\r\npale face as she put her arms round me and said softly, "Oh, thank God\r\nfor good brave men!"  With a sigh she sank back again to sleep.  I\r\nwrite this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n4 October, morning.--Once again during the night I was wakened by\r\nMina.  This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the\r\ncoming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas\r\nflame was like a speck rather than a disc of light.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe said to me hurriedly, "Go, call the Professor.  I want to see him\r\nat once."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Why?" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I have an idea.  I suppose it must have come in the night, and\r\nmatured without my knowing it.  He must hypnotize me before the dawn,\r\nand then I shall be able to speak.  Go quick, dearest, the time is\r\ngetting close."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI went to the door.  Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and\r\nseeing me, he sprang to his feet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Is anything wrong?" he asked, in alarm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No," I replied.  "But Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I will go," he said, and hurried into the Professor''s room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTwo or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressing\r\ngown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at the\r\ndoor asking questions.  When the Professor saw Mina a smile, a\r\npositive smile ousted the anxiety of his face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe rubbed his hands as he said, "Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is\r\nindeed a change.  See!  Friend Jonathan, we have got our dear Madam\r\nMina, as of old, back to us today!"  Then turning to her, he said\r\ncheerfully, "And what am I to do for you?  For at this hour you do not\r\nwant me for nothing."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I want you to hypnotize me!" she said.  "Do it before the dawn, for I\r\nfeel that then I can speak, and speak freely.  Be quick, for the time\r\nis short!"  Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLooking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,\r\nfrom over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn.  Mina\r\ngazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat\r\nlike a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand.\r\nGradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still.  Only by the\r\ngentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive.  The\r\nProfessor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see\r\nthat his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration.  Mina\r\nopened her eyes, but she did not seem the same woman.  There was a\r\nfar-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which\r\nwas new to me.  Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor\r\nmotioned to me to bring the others in.  They came on tiptoe, closing\r\nthe door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on.\r\nMina appeared not to see them.  The stillness was broken by Van\r\nHelsing''s voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the\r\ncurrent of her thoughts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Where are you?"  The answer came in a neutral way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I do not know.  Sleep has no place it can call its own."  For several\r\nminutes there was silence.  Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood\r\nstaring at her fixedly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe rest of us hardly dared to breathe.  The room was growing lighter.\r\nWithout taking his eyes from Mina''s face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me\r\nto pull up the blind.  I did so, and the day seemed just upon us.  A\r\nred streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through\r\nthe room.  On the instant the Professor spoke again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Where are you now?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe answer came dreamily, but with intention.  It were as though she\r\nwere interpreting something.  I have heard her use the same tone when\r\nreading her shorthand notes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I do not know.  It is all strange to me!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What do you see?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I can see nothing.  It is all dark."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What do you hear?"  I could detect the strain in the Professor''s\r\npatient voice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The lapping of water.  It is gurgling by, and little waves leap.  I\r\ncan hear them on the outside."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then you are on a ship?''"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the\r\nother.  We were afraid to think.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe answer came quick, "Oh, yes!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What else do you hear?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about.  There is the\r\ncreaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan\r\nfalls into the ratchet."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What are you doing?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I am still, oh so still.  It is like death!"  The voice faded away\r\ninto a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of\r\nday.  Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina''s shoulders, and laid\r\nher head down softly on her pillow.  She lay like a sleeping child for\r\na few moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder\r\nto see us all around her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Have I been talking in my sleep?" was all she said.  She seemed,\r\nhowever, to know the situation without telling, though she was eager\r\nto know what she had told.  The Professor repeated the conversation,\r\nand she said, "Then there is not a moment to lose.  It may not be yet\r\ntoo late!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor''s\r\ncalm voice called them back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Stay, my friends.  That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor at\r\nthe moment in your so great Port of London.  Which of them is it that\r\nyou seek?  God be thanked that we have once again a clue, though\r\nwhither it may lead us we know not.  We have been blind somewhat.\r\nBlind after the manner of men, since we can look back we see what we\r\nmight have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we\r\nmight have seen!  Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?  We\r\ncan know now what was in the Count''s mind, when he seize that money,\r\nthough Jonathan''s so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he\r\ndread.  He meant escape.  Hear me, ESCAPE!  He saw that with but one\r\nearth box left, and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox,\r\nthis London was no place for him.  He have take his last earth box on\r\nboard a ship, and he leave the land.  He think to escape, but no!  We\r\nfollow him.  Tally Ho!  As friend Arthur would say when he put on his\r\nred frock!  Our old fox is wily.  Oh!  So wily, and we must follow\r\nwith wile.  I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a little while.\r\nIn meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are between us which\r\nhe do not want to pass, and which he could not if he would.  Unless\r\nthe ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide.\r\nSee, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is us.  Let us\r\ntake bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need, and which\r\nwe can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMina looked at him appealingly as she asked, "But why need we seek him\r\nfurther, when he is gone away from us?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe took her hand and patted it as he replied, "Ask me nothing as yet.\r\nWhen we have breakfast, then I answer all questions."  He would say no\r\nmore, and we separated to dress.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter breakfast Mina repeated her question.  He looked at her gravely\r\nfor a minute and then said sorrowfully, "Because my dear, dear Madam\r\nMina, now more than ever must we find him even if we have to follow\r\nhim to the jaws of Hell!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe grew paler as she asked faintly, "Why?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Because," he answered solemnly, "he can live for centuries, and you\r\nare but mortal woman.  Time is now to be dreaded, since once he put\r\nthat mark upon your throat."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

He have gone back to\r\nhis Castle in Transylvania.  I know it so well, as if a great hand of\r\nfire wrote it on the wall.  He have prepare for this in some way, and\r\nthat last earth box was ready to ship somewheres.  For this he took\r\nthe money.  For this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before\r\nthe sun go down.

Already the\r\ncertainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort.\r\nAnd comfort is strength to her.  For my own part, now that his\r\nhorrible danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost\r\nimpossible to believe in it.  Even my own terrible experiences in\r\nCastle Dracula seem like a long forgotten dream.  Here in the crisp\r\nautumn air in the bright sunlight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlas!  How can I disbelieve!  In the midst of my thought my eye fell\r\non the red scar on my poor darling''s white forehead.  Whilst that\r\nlasts, there can be no disbelief.  Mina and I fear to be idle, so we\r\nhave been over all the diaries again and again.  Somehow, although the\r\nreality seem greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less.  There\r\nis something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is\r\ncomforting.  Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate\r\ngood.  It may be!  I shall try to think as she does.  We have never\r\nspoken to each other yet of the future.  It is better to wait till we\r\nsee the Professor and the others after their investigations.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run\r\nfor me again.

Present:  Professor Van\r\nHelsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan\r\nHarker, Mina Harker.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to\r\ndiscover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure\r\nthat he must go by the Danube mouth, or by somewhere in the Black Sea,\r\nsince by that way he come.  It was a dreary blank that was before us.\r\n<i>Omne ignotum pro magnifico</i>; and so with heavy hearts we start to find\r\nwhat ships leave for the Black Sea last night.  He was in sailing\r\nship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set.  These not so\r\nimportant as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so\r\nwe go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd''s, where are\r\nnote of all ships that sail, however so small.  There we find that\r\nonly one Black Sea bound ship go out with the tide.  She is the\r\nCzarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittle''s Wharf for Varna, and\r\nthence to other ports and up the Danube.  ''So!'' said I, ''this is the\r\nship whereon is the Count.''  So off we go to Doolittle''s Wharf, and\r\nthere we find a man in an office.  From him we inquire of the goings\r\nof the Czarina Catherine.  He swear much, and he red face and loud of\r\nvoice, but he good fellow all the same.  And when Quincey give him\r\nsomething from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it\r\nin a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still\r\nbetter fellow and humble servant to us.  He come with us, and ask many\r\nmen who are rough and hot.  These be better fellows too when they have\r\nbeen no more thirsty.  They say much of blood and bloom, and of others\r\nwhich I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean.  But\r\nnevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five\r\no''clock comes a man so hurry.  A tall man, thin and pale, with high\r\nnose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning.  That he be\r\nall in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or\r\nthe time.  That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to\r\nwhat ship sails for the Black Sea and for where.  Some took him to the\r\noffice and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at\r\nshore end of gangplank, and ask that the captain come to him.  The\r\ncaptain come, when told that he will be pay well, and though he swear\r\nmuch at the first he agree to term.  Then the thin man go and some one\r\ntell him where horse and cart can be hired.  He go there and soon he\r\ncome again, himself driving cart on which a great box.  This he\r\nhimself lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the\r\nship.  He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to\r\nbe place.  But the captain like it not and swear at him in many\r\ntongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it\r\nshall be.  But he say ''no,'' that he come not yet, for that he have\r\nmuch to do.  Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be\r\nquick, with blood, for that his ship will leave the place, of blood,\r\nbefore the turn of the tide, with blood.  Then the thin man smile and\r\nsay that of course he must go when he think fit, but he will be\r\nsurprise if he go quite so soon.  The captain swear again, polyglot,\r\nand the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so\r\nfar intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing.\r\nFinal the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues, tell him\r\nthat he doesn''t want no Frenchmen, with bloom upon them and also with\r\nblood, in his ship, with blood on her also.  And so, after asking\r\nwhere he might purchase ship forms, he departed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No one knew where he went ''or bloomin'' well cared'' as they said, for\r\nthey had something else to think of, well with blood again.  For it\r\nsoon became apparent to all that the Czarina Catherine would not sail\r\nas was expected.  A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it\r\ngrew, and grew.  Till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all\r\naround her.  The captain swore polyglot, very polyglot, polyglot with\r\nbloom and blood, but he could do nothing.  The water rose and rose,\r\nand he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether.  He was\r\nin no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the\r\ngangplank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed.  Then\r\nthe captain replied that he wished that he and his box, old and with\r\nmuch bloom and blood, were in hell.  But the thin man did not be\r\noffend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and\r\ncame up and stood awhile on deck in fog.  He must have come off by\r\nhimself, for none notice him.  Indeed they thought not of him, for\r\nsoon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again.  My friends\r\nof the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as\r\nthey told how the captain''s swears exceeded even his usual polyglot,\r\nand was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other\r\nmariners who were on movement up and down the river that hour, he\r\nfound that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay\r\nround the wharf.  However, the ship went out on the ebb tide, and was\r\ndoubtless by morning far down the river mouth.  She was then, when\r\nthey told us, well out to sea.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time,\r\nfor our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way\r\nto the Danube mouth.  To sail a ship takes time, go she never so\r\nquick.  And when we start to go on land more quick, and we meet him\r\nthere.  Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between\r\nsunrise and sunset.  For then he can make no struggle, and we may deal\r\nwith him as we should.  There are days for us, in which we can make\r\nready our plan.  We know all about where he go.  For we have seen the\r\nowner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can\r\nbe.  The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an\r\nagent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials.  And so our\r\nmerchant friend will have done his part.  When he ask if there be any\r\nwrong, for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna,\r\nwe say ''no,'' for what is to be done is not for police or of the\r\ncustoms.  It must be done by us alone and in our own way."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain\r\nthat the Count had remained on board the ship.  He replied, "We have\r\nthe best proof of that, your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance\r\nthis morning."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue\r\nthe Count, for oh!  I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that he\r\nwould surely go if the others went.  He answered in growing passion,\r\nat first quietly.  As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more\r\nforceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least\r\nsome of that personal dominance which made him so long a master\r\namongst men.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes, it is necessary, necessary, necessary!  For your sake in the\r\nfirst, and then for the sake of humanity.  This monster has done much\r\nharm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the\r\nshort time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small\r\nmeasure in darkness and not knowing.  All this have I told these\r\nothers.  You, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of\r\nmy friend John, or in that of your husband.  I have told them how the\r\nmeasure of leaving his own barren land, barren of peoples, and coming\r\nto a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude\r\nof standing corn, was the work of centuries.  Were another of the\r\nUndead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the\r\ncenturies of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him.\r\nWith this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and\r\nstrong must have worked together in some wonderous way.  The very\r\nplace, where he have been alive, Undead for all these centuries, is\r\nfull of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world.  There are\r\ndeep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.  There have\r\nbeen volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of\r\nstrange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify.  Doubtless,\r\nthere is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations\r\nof occult forces which work for physical life in strange way, and in\r\nhimself were from the first some great qualities.  In a hard and\r\nwarlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more\r\nsubtle brain, more braver heart, than any man.  In him some vital\r\nprinciple have in strange way found their utmost.  And as his body\r\nkeep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too.  All this\r\nwithout that diabolic aid which is surely to him.  For it have to\r\nyield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good.  And\r\nnow this is what he is to us.  He have infect you, oh forgive me, my\r\ndear, that I must say such, but it is for good of you that I speak.  He\r\ninfect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to\r\nlive, to live in your own old, sweet way, and so in time, death, which\r\nis of man''s common lot and with God''s sanction, shall make you like to\r\nhim.  This must not be!  We have sworn together that it must not.\r\nThus are we ministers of God''s own wish.  That the world, and men for\r\nwhom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very\r\nexistence would defame Him.  He have allowed us to redeem one soul\r\nalready, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem\r\nmore.  Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise.  And like them,\r\nif we fall, we fall in good cause."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe paused and I said, "But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely?\r\nSince he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a\r\ntiger does the village from which he has been hunted?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Aha!" he said, "your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall\r\nadopt him.  Your maneater, as they of India call the tiger who has\r\nonce tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but\r\nprowl unceasing till he get him.  This that we hunt from our village\r\nis a tiger, too, a maneater, and he never cease to prowl.  Nay, in\r\nhimself he is not one to retire and stay afar.  In his life, his\r\nliving life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on\r\nhis own ground.  He be beaten back, but did he stay?  No!  He come\r\nagain, and again, and again.  Look at his persistence and endurance.\r\nWith the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the\r\nidea of coming to a great city.  What does he do?  He find out the\r\nplace of all the world most of promise for him.  Then he deliberately\r\nset himself down to prepare for the task.  He find in patience just\r\nhow is his strength, and what are his powers.  He study new tongues.\r\nHe learn new social life, new environment of old ways, the politics,\r\nthe law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new\r\npeople who have come to be since he was.  His glimpse that he have\r\nhad, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire.  Nay, it help him\r\nto grow as to his brain.  For it all prove to him how right he was at\r\nthe first in his surmises.  He have done this alone, all alone!  From\r\na ruin tomb in a forgotten land.  What more may he not do when the\r\ngreater world of thought is open to him.  He that can smile at death,\r\nas we know him.  Who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill\r\noff whole peoples.  Oh!  If such an one was to come from God, and not\r\nthe Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of\r\nours.  But we are pledged to set the world free.  Our toil must be in\r\nsilence, and our efforts all in secret.  For in this enlightened age,\r\nwhen men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men\r\nwould be his greatest strength.  It would be at once his sheath and\r\nhis armor, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing\r\nto peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love.  For the\r\ngood of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a general discussion it was determined that for tonight nothing\r\nbe definitely settled.  That we should all sleep on the facts, and try\r\nto think out the proper conclusions.  Tomorrow, at breakfast, we are\r\nto meet again, and after making our conclusions known to one another,\r\nwe shall decide on some definite cause of action&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight.  It is as if some haunting\r\npresence were removed from me.  Perhaps&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy surmise was not finished, could not be, for I caught sight in the\r\nmirror of the red mark upon my forehead, and I knew that I was still\r\nunclean.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n5 October.--We all arose early, and I think that sleep did much for\r\neach and all of us.  When we met at early breakfast there was more\r\ngeneral cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience\r\nagain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature.\r\nLet any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way, even\r\nby death, and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment.\r\nMore than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder\r\nwhether the whole of the past days had not been a dream.  It was only\r\nwhen I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker''s forehead that I\r\nwas brought back to reality.  Even now, when I am gravely revolving\r\nthe matter, it is almost impossible to realize that the cause of all\r\nour trouble is still existent.  Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight\r\nof her trouble for whole spells.  It is only now and again, when\r\nsomething recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible\r\nscar.  We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on\r\nour course of action.  I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it\r\nby instinct rather than reason.  We shall all have to speak frankly.\r\nAnd yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker''s tongue\r\nis tied.  I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all\r\nthat has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be.\r\nBut she will not, or cannot, give them utterance.  I have mentioned\r\nthis to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are\r\nalone.  I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into\r\nher veins beginning to work.  The Count had his own purposes when he\r\ngave her what Van Helsing called "the Vampire''s baptism of blood."\r\nWell, there may be a poison that distills itself out of good things.\r\nIn an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not\r\nwonder at anything!  One thing I know, that if my instinct be true\r\nregarding poor Mrs. Harker''s silences, then there is a terrible\r\ndifficulty, an unknown danger, in the work before us.  The same power\r\nthat compels her silence may compel her speech.  I dare not think\r\nfurther, for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of\r\nthings.  I could see that he had something on his mind, which he\r\nwanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject.\r\nAfter beating about the bush a little, he said, "Friend John, there is\r\nsomething that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any\r\nrate.  Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen he stopped, so I waited.  He went on, "Madam Mina, our poor, dear\r\nMadam Mina is changing."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed.\r\nVan Helsing continued.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned\r\nbefore things go too far.  Our task is now in reality more difficult\r\nthan ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst\r\nimportance.  I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in\r\nher face.  It is now but very, very slight.  But it is to be seen if\r\nwe have eyes to notice without prejudge.  Her teeth are sharper, and\r\nat times her eyes are more hard.  But these are not all, there is to\r\nher the silence now often, as so it was with Miss Lucy.  She did not\r\nspeak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later.\r\nNow my fear is this.  If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance,\r\ntell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have\r\nhypnotize her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her\r\ndrink of his, should if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him\r\nthat which she know?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI nodded acquiescence.  He went on, "Then, what we must do is to\r\nprevent this.  We must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she\r\ncannot tell what she know not.  This is a painful task!  Oh, so\r\npainful that it heartbreak me to think of it, but it must be.  When\r\ntoday we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not to\r\nspeak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by\r\nus."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at\r\nthe thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor\r\nsoul already so tortured.  I knew that it would be some sort of\r\ncomfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same\r\nconclusion.  For at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt.  I\r\ntold him, and the effect was as I expected.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is now close to the time of our general gathering.  Van Helsing has\r\ngone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it.  I\r\nreally believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was\r\nexperienced by both Van Helsing and myself.  Mrs. Harker had sent a\r\nmessage by her husband to say that she would not join us at present,\r\nas she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our\r\nmovements without her presence to embarrass us.  The Professor and I\r\nlooked at each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed\r\nrelieved.  For my own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realized the\r\ndanger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted.\r\nUnder the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer,\r\nwith finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, until we\r\nshould have been able to confer alone again.  We went at once into our\r\nPlan of Campaign.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing roughly put the facts before us first, "The Czarina\r\nCatherine left the Thames yesterday morning.  It will take her at the\r\nquickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna.\r\nBut we can travel overland to the same place in three days.  Now, if\r\nwe allow for two days less for the ship''s voyage, owing to such\r\nweather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear, and if\r\nwe allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,\r\nthen we have a margin of nearly two weeks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at\r\nlatest.  Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship\r\narrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary.  Of\r\ncourse we shall all go armed, armed against evil things, spiritual as\r\nwell as physical."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere Quincey Morris added, "I understand that the Count comes from a\r\nwolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us.  I\r\npropose that we add Winchesters to our armament.  I have a kind of\r\nbelief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around.\r\nDo you remember, Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk?  What\r\nwouldn''t we have given then for a repeater apiece!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good!" said Van Helsing, "Winchesters it shall be.  Quincey''s head is\r\nlevel at times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more\r\ndishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man.  In the meantime\r\nwe can do nothing here.  And as I think that Varna is not familiar to\r\nany of us, why not go there more soon?  It is as long to wait here as\r\nthere.  Tonight and tomorrow we can get ready, and then if all be\r\nwell, we four can set out on our journey."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We four?" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of\r\nus.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Of course!" answered the Professor quickly.  "You must remain to take\r\ncare of your so sweet wife!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHarker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice, "Let us\r\ntalk of that part of it in the morning.  I want to consult with Mina."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to\r\ndisclose our plan to her, but he took no notice.  I looked at him\r\nsignificantly and coughed.  For answer he put his finger to his lips\r\nand turned away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n5 October, afternoon.--For some time after our meeting this morning I\r\ncould not think.  The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of\r\nwonder which allows no room for active thought.  Mina''s determination\r\nnot to take any part in the discussion set me thinking.  And as I\r\ncould not argue the matter with her, I could only guess.  I am as far\r\nas ever from a solution now.  The way the others received it, too\r\npuzzled me.  The last time we talked of the subject we agreed that\r\nthere was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us.  Mina is\r\nsleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child.  Her lips are\r\ncurved and her face beams with happiness.  Thank God, there are such\r\nmoments still for her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--How strange it all is.  I sat watching Mina''s happy sleep, and\r\nI came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be.  As\r\nthe evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun\r\nsinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to\r\nme.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly said,\r\n"Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour.\r\nA promise made to me, but made holily in God''s hearing, and not to be\r\nbroken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter\r\ntears.  Quick, you must make it to me at once."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Mina," I said, "a promise like that, I cannot make at once.  I may\r\nhave no right to make it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But, dear one," she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes\r\nwere like pole stars, "it is I who wish it.  And it is not for myself.\r\nYou can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right.  If he disagrees you\r\nmay do as you will.  Nay, more if you all agree, later you are\r\nabsolved from the promise."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I promise!" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy.\r\nThough to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her\r\nforehead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe said, "Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans\r\nformed for the campaign against the Count.  Not by word, or inference,\r\nor implication, not at any time whilst this remains to me!"  And she\r\nsolemnly pointed to the scar.  I saw that she was in earnest, and said\r\nsolemnly, "I promise!" and as I said it I felt that from that instant\r\na door had been shut between us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater, midnight.--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.\r\nSo much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected\r\nsomewhat with her gaiety.  As a result even I myself felt as if the\r\npall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted.  We all\r\nretired early.  Mina is now sleeping like a little child.  It is\r\nwonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst\r\nof her terrible trouble.  Thank God for it, for then at least she can\r\nforget her care.  Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did\r\ntonight.  I shall try it.  Oh!  For a dreamless sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n6 October, morning.--Another surprise.  Mina woke me early, about the\r\nsame time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing.  I\r\nthought that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without\r\nquestion went for the Professor.  He had evidently expected some such\r\ncall, for I found him dressed in his room.  His door was ajar, so that\r\nhe could hear the opening of the door of our room.  He came at once.\r\nAs he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the others might come,\r\ntoo.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No," she said quite simply, "it will not be necessary.  You can tell\r\nthem just as well.  I must go with you on your journey."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was.  After a moment''s pause he\r\nasked, "But why?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You must take me with you.  I am safer with you, and you shall be\r\nsafer, too."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But why, dear Madam Mina?  You know that your safety is our solemnest\r\nduty.  We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable\r\nthan any of us from&#8230; from circumstances&#8230; things that have\r\nbeen."  He paused embarrassed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead.  "I\r\nknow.  That is why I must go.  I can tell you now, whilst the sun is\r\ncoming up.  I may not be able again.  I know that when the Count wills\r\nme I must go.  I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must by\r\nwile.  By any device to hoodwink, even Jonathan."  God saw the look\r\nthat she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording\r\nAngel that look is noted to her ever-lasting honour.  I could only\r\nclasp her hand.  I could not speak.  My emotion was too great for even\r\nthe relief of tears.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe went on.  "You men are brave and strong.  You are strong in your\r\nnumbers, for you can defy that which would break down the human\r\nendurance of one who had to guard alone.  Besides, I may be of\r\nservice, since you can hypnotize me and so learn that which even I\r\nmyself do not know."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Van Helsing said gravely, "Madam Mina, you are, as always, most\r\nwise.  You shall with us come.  And together we shall do that which we\r\ngo forth to achieve."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he had spoken, Mina''s long spell of silence made me look at her.\r\nShe had fallen back on her pillow asleep.  She did not even wake when\r\nI had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the\r\nroom.  Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly.  We went\r\nto his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.\r\nMorris were with us also.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe told them what Mina had said, and went on.  "In the morning we\r\nshall leave for Varna.  We have now to deal with a new factor, Madam\r\nMina.  Oh, but her soul is true.  It is to her an agony to tell us so\r\nmuch as she has done.  But it is most right, and we are warned in\r\ntime.  There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready to\r\nact the instant when that ship arrives."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What shall we do exactly?" asked Mr. Morris laconically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor paused before replying, "We shall at the first board\r\nthat ship.  Then, when we have identified the box, we shall place a\r\nbranch of the wild rose on it.  This we shall fasten, for when it is\r\nthere none can emerge, so that at least says the superstition.  And to\r\nsuperstition must we trust at the first.  It was man''s faith in the\r\nearly, and it have its root in faith still.  Then, when we get the\r\nopportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the\r\nbox, and&#8230; and all will be well."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I shall not wait for any opportunity," said Morris.  "When I see the\r\nbox I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a\r\nthousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next\r\nmoment!"  I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a\r\npiece of steel.  I think he understood my look.  I hope he did.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good boy," said Dr. Van Helsing.  "Brave boy.  Quincey is all man.\r\nGod bless him for it.  My child, believe me none of us shall lag\r\nbehind or pause from any fear.  I do but say what we may do&#8230; what\r\nwe must do.  But, indeed, indeed we cannot say what we may do.  There\r\nare so many things which may happen, and their ways and their ends are\r\nso various that until the moment we may not say.  We shall all be\r\narmed, in all ways.  And when the time for the end has come, our\r\neffort shall not be lack.  Now let us today put all our affairs in\r\norder.  Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and who on us\r\ndepend, be complete.  For none of us can tell what, or when, or how,\r\nthe end may be.  As for me, my own affairs are regulate, and as I have\r\nnothing else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the travel.  I\r\nshall have all tickets and so forth for our journey."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was nothing further to be said, and we parted.  I shall now\r\nsettle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--It is done.  My will is made, and all complete.  Mina if she\r\nsurvive is my sole heir.  If it should not be so, then the others who\r\nhave been so good to us shall have remainder.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is now drawing towards the sunset.  Mina''s uneasiness calls my\r\nattention to it.  I am sure that there is something on her mind which\r\nthe time of exact sunset will reveal.  These occasions are becoming\r\nharrowing times for us all.  For each sunrise and sunset opens up some\r\nnew danger, some new pain, which however, may in God''s will be means\r\nto a good end.  I write all these things in the diary since my darling\r\nmust not hear them now.  But if it may be that she can see them again,\r\nthey shall be ready.  She is calling to me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n11 October, Evening.--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he\r\nsays he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record\r\nkept.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.\r\nHarker a little before the time of sunset.  We have of late come to\r\nunderstand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar\r\nfreedom.  When her old self can be manifest without any controlling\r\nforce subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action.  This\r\nmood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise\r\nor sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds\r\nare still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon.  At first\r\nthere is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened,\r\nand then the absolute freedom quickly follows.  When, however, the\r\nfreedom ceases the change back or relapse comes quickly, preceded\r\nonly by a spell of warning silence.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTonight, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the\r\nsigns of an internal struggle.  I put it down myself to her making a\r\nviolent effort at the earliest instant she could do so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA very few minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself.\r\nThen, motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she\r\nwas half reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTaking her husband''s hand in hers, she began, "We are all here\r\ntogether in freedom, for perhaps the last time!  I know that you will\r\nalways be with me to the end."  This was to her husband whose hand had,\r\nas we could see, tightened upon her.  "In the morning we go out upon\r\nour task, and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us.  You\r\nare going to be so good to me to take me with you.  I know that all\r\nthat brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whose soul\r\nperhaps is lost, no, no, not yet, but is at any rate at stake, you\r\nwill do.  But you must remember that I am not as you are.  There is a\r\npoison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me, which must\r\ndestroy me, unless some relief comes to us.  Oh, my friends, you know\r\nas well as I do, that my soul is at stake.  And though I know there is\r\none way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!"  She looked\r\nappealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What is that way?" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice.  "What is\r\nthat way, which we must not, may not, take?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before\r\nthe greater evil is entirely wrought.  I know, and you know, that were\r\nI once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as\r\nyou did my poor Lucy''s.  Were death, or the fear of death, the only\r\nthing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here now, amidst\r\nthe friends who love me.  But death is not all.  I cannot believe that\r\nto die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task\r\nto be done, is God''s will.  Therefore, I on my part, give up here the\r\ncertainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the\r\nblackest things that the world or the nether world holds!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a\r\nprelude.  The faces of the others were set, and Harker''s grew ashen\r\ngrey.  Perhaps, he guessed better than any of us what was coming.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe continued, "This is what I can give into the hotch-pot."  I could\r\nnot but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place,\r\nand with all seriousness.  "What will each of you give?  Your lives I\r\nknow," she went on quickly, "that is easy for brave men.  Your lives\r\nare God''s, and you can give them back to Him, but what will you give\r\nto me?"  She looked again questioningly, but this time avoided her\r\nhusband''s face.  Quincey seemed to understand, he nodded, and her face\r\nlit up.  "Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be\r\nno doubtful matter in this connection between us now.  You must\r\npromise me, one and all, even you, my beloved husband, that should the\r\ntime come, you will kill me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What is that time?"  The voice was Quincey''s, but it was low and\r\nstrained.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better\r\nthat I die that I may live.  When I am thus dead in the flesh, then\r\nyou will, without a moment''s delay, drive a stake through me and cut\r\noff my head, or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nQuincey was the first to rise after the pause.  He knelt down before\r\nher and taking her hand in his said solemnly, "I''m only a rough\r\nfellow, who hasn''t, perhaps, lived as a man should to win such a\r\ndistinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and dear\r\nthat, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty that\r\nyou have set us.  And I promise you, too, that I shall make all\r\ncertain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has\r\ncome!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My true friend!" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears,\r\nas bending over, she kissed his hand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!" said Van Helsing.  "And I!"\r\nsaid Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the\r\noath.  I followed, myself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor\r\nwhich subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair, and asked, "And must I,\r\ntoo, make such a promise, oh, my wife?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You too, my dearest," she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her\r\nvoice and eyes.  "You must not shrink.  You are nearest and dearest\r\nand all the world to me.  Our souls are knit into one, for all life\r\nand all time.  Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men\r\nhave killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling\r\ninto the hands of the enemy.  Their hands did not falter any the more\r\nbecause those that they loved implored them to slay them.  It is men''s\r\nduty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial!  And\r\noh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it\r\nbe at the hand of him that loves me best.  Dr. Van Helsing, I have not\r\nforgotten your mercy in poor Lucy''s case to him who loved."  She\r\nstopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase, "to him who had\r\nbest right to give her peace.  If that time shall come again, I look\r\nto you to make it a happy memory of my husband''s life that it was his\r\nloving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Again I swear!" came the Professor''s resonant voice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she\r\nleaned back and said, "And now one word of warning, a warning which\r\nyou must never forget.  This time, if it ever come, may come quickly\r\nand unexpectedly, and in such case you must lose no time in using your\r\nopportunity.  At such a time I myself might be&#8230; nay!  If the time\r\never come, shall be, leagued with your enemy against you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"One more request," she became very solemn as she said this, "it is\r\nnot vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing\r\nfor me, if you will."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe all acquiesced, but no one spoke.  There was no need to speak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I want you to read the Burial Service."  She was interrupted by a\r\ndeep groan from her husband.  Taking his hand in hers, she held it\r\nover her heart, and continued.  "You must read it over me some day.\r\nWhatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will\r\nbe a sweet thought to all or some of us.  You, my dearest, will I hope\r\nread it, for then it will be in your voice in my memory forever, come\r\nwhat may!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"But oh, my dear one," he pleaded, "death is afar off from you."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Nay," she said, holding up a warning hand.  "I am deeper in death at\r\nthis moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, my wife, must I read it?" he said, before he began.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It would comfort me, my husband!" was all she said, and he began to\r\nread when she had got the book ready.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHow can I, how could anyone, tell of that strange scene, its\r\nsolemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror, and withal, its\r\nsweetness.  Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of\r\nbitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to\r\nthe heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends\r\nkneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender\r\npassion of her husband''s voice, as in tones so broken and emotional\r\nthat often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service\r\nfrom the Burial of the Dead.  I cannot go on&#8230; words&#8230; and\r\nv-voices&#8230; f-fail m-me!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe was right in her instinct.  Strange as it was, bizarre as it may\r\nhereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time,\r\nit comforted us much.  And the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker''s\r\ncoming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of\r\ndespair to any of us as we had dreaded.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n15 October, Varna.--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,\r\ngot to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the\r\nOrient Express.  We traveled night and day, arriving here at about\r\nfive o''clock.  Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any\r\ntelegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this\r\nhotel, "the Odessus."  The journey may have had incidents.  I was,\r\nhowever, too eager to get on, to care for them.  Until the Czarina\r\nCatherine comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything\r\nin the wide world.  Thank God!  Mina is well, and looks to be getting\r\nstronger.  Her colour is coming back.  She sleeps a great deal.\r\nThroughout the journey she slept nearly all the time.  Before sunrise\r\nand sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert.  And it has become\r\na habit for Van Helsing to hypnotize her at such times.  At first,\r\nsome effort was needed, and he had to make many passes.  But now, she\r\nseems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is\r\nneeded.  He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply\r\nwill, and her thoughts obey him.  He always asks her what she can see\r\nand hear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe answers to the first, "Nothing, all is dark."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd to the second, "I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and\r\nthe water rushing by.  Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards\r\ncreak.  The wind is high&#8230; I can hear it in the shrouds, and the\r\nbow throws back the foam."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea, hastening on\r\nher way to Varna.  Lord Godalming has just returned.  He had four\r\ntelegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect.\r\nThat the Czarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyd''s from\r\nanywhere.  He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should\r\nsend him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported.\r\nHe was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he\r\nmight be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of\r\nthe wire.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe had dinner and went to bed early.  Tomorrow we are to see the Vice\r\nConsul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as\r\nsoon as she arrives.  Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get\r\non the boat between sunrise and sunset.  The Count, even if he takes\r\nthe form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition,\r\nand so cannot leave the ship.  As he dare not change to man''s form\r\nwithout suspicion, which he evidently wishes to avoid, he must remain\r\nin the box.  If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at\r\nour mercy, for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of\r\npoor Lucy, before he wakes.  What mercy he shall get from us all will\r\nnot count for much.  We think that we shall not have much trouble with\r\nofficials or the seamen.  Thank God!  This is the country where\r\nbribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money.  We have\r\nonly to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset\r\nand sunrise without our being warned, and we shall be safe.  Judge\r\nMoneybag will settle this case, I think!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n16 October.--Mina''s report still the same.  Lapping waves and rushing\r\nwater, darkness and favouring winds.  We are evidently in good time,\r\nand when we hear of the Czarina Catherine we shall be ready.  As she\r\nmust pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n17 October.--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome\r\nthe Count on his return from his tour.  Godalming told the shippers\r\nthat he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something\r\nstolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open\r\nit at his own risk.  The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to\r\ngive him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship,\r\nand also a similar authorization to his agent at Varna.  We have seen\r\nthe agent, who was much impressed with Godalming''s kindly manner to\r\nhim, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our\r\nwishes will be done.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open.  If\r\nthe Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at\r\nonce and drive a stake through his heart.  Morris and Godalming and I\r\nshall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we\r\nshall have ready.  The Professor says that if we can so treat the\r\nCount''s body, it will soon after fall into dust.  In such case there\r\nwould be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were\r\naroused.  But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act,\r\nand perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between\r\nsome of us and a rope.  For myself, I should take the chance only too\r\nthankfully if it were to come.  We mean to leave no stone unturned to\r\ncarry out our intent.  We have arranged with certain officials that\r\nthe instant the Czarina Catherine is seen, we are to be informed by a\r\nspecial messenger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n24 October.--A whole week of waiting.  Daily telegrams to Godalming,\r\nbut only the same story.  "Not yet reported."  Mina''s morning and\r\nevening hypnotic answer is unvaried.  Lapping waves, rushing water,\r\nand creaking masts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTELEGRAM, OCTOBER 24TH RUFUS SMITH, LLOYD''S, LONDON,\r\nTO LORD GODALMING, CARE OF H. B. M. VICE CONSUL, VARNA\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n25 October.--How I miss my phonograph!  To write a diary with a pen is\r\nirksome to me!  But Van Helsing says I must.  We were all wild with\r\nexcitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd''s.  I\r\nknow now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard.\r\nMrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion.\r\nAfter all, it is not strange that she did not, for we took special\r\ncare not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to\r\nshow any excitement when we were in her presence.  In old days she\r\nwould, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to\r\nconceal it.  But in this way she is greatly changed during the past\r\nthree weeks.  The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong\r\nand well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are\r\nnot satisfied.  We talk of her often.  We have not, however, said a\r\nword to the others.  It would break poor Harker''s heart, certainly his\r\nnerve, if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject.  Van\r\nHelsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is\r\nin the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not\r\nbegin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her.  If\r\nthis change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!  We both\r\nknow what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our\r\nthoughts to each other.  We should neither of us shrink from the task,\r\nawful though it be to contemplate.  "Euthanasia" is an excellent and a\r\ncomforting word!  I am grateful to whoever invented it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is only about 24 hours'' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the\r\nrate the Czarina Catherine has come from London.  She should therefore\r\narrive some time in the morning, but as she cannot possibly get in\r\nbefore noon, we are all about to retire early.  We shall get up at one\r\no''clock, so as to be ready.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n25 October, Noon.--No news yet of the ship''s arrival.  Mrs. Harker''s\r\nhypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible\r\nthat we may get news at any moment.  We men are all in a fever of\r\nexcitement, except Harker, who is calm.  His hands are cold as ice,\r\nand an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka\r\nknife which he now always carries with him.  It will be a bad lookout\r\nfor the Count if the edge of that "Kukri" ever touches his throat,\r\ndriven by that stern, ice-cold hand!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker today.\r\nAbout noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like.\r\nAlthough we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy\r\nabout it.  She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at\r\nfirst glad to know that she was sleeping.  When, however, her husband\r\nmentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not\r\nwake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves.  She was breathing\r\nnaturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the\r\nsleep was better for her than anything else.  Poor girl, she has so\r\nmuch to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion\r\nto her, does her good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep\r\nof some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had\r\nbeen for days.  At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report.\r\nWherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his\r\ndestination.  To his doom, I trust!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n26 October.--Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine.  She\r\nought to be here by now.  That she is still journeying somewhere is\r\napparent, for Mrs. Harker''s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the\r\nsame.  It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for\r\nfog.  Some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches\r\nof fog both to north and south of the port.  We must continue our\r\nwatching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n27 October, Noon.--Most strange.  No news yet of the ship we wait for.\r\nMrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual.  "Lapping\r\nwaves and rushing water," though she added that "the waves were very\r\nfaint."  The telegrams from London have been the same, "no further\r\nreport."  Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he\r\nfears the Count is escaping us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe added significantly, "I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina''s.\r\nSouls and memories can do strange things during trance."  I was about\r\nto ask him more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a\r\nwarning hand.  We must try tonight at sunset to make her speak more\r\nfully when in her hypnotic state.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n28 October.--Telegram.  Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming, care\r\nH. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Czarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one o''clock today."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n28 October.--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I\r\ndo not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been\r\nexpected.  True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt\r\nwould come.  But I think we all expected that something strange would\r\nhappen.  The day of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied\r\nthat things would not be just as we had expected.  We only waited to\r\nlearn where the change would occur.  None the less, however, it was a\r\nsurprise.  I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we\r\nbelieve against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not\r\nas we should know that they will be.  Transcendentalism is a beacon to\r\nthe angels, even if it be a will-o''-the-wisp to man.  Van Helsing\r\nraised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance\r\nwith the Almighty.  But he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood\r\nup with his face sternly set.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily.  I was\r\nmyself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another.\r\nQuincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I\r\nknew so well.  In our old wandering days it meant "action."  Mrs.\r\nHarker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to\r\nburn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer.  Harker\r\nsmiled, actually smiled, the dark, bitter smile of one who is without\r\nhope, but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands\r\ninstinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested\r\nthere.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"When does the next train start for Galatz?" said Van Helsing to us\r\ngenerally.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"At 6:30 tomorrow morning!"  We all started, for the answer came from\r\nMrs. Harker.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How on earth do you know?" said Art.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You forget, or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so\r\ndoes Dr. Van Helsing, that I am the train fiend.  At home in Exeter I\r\nalways used to make up the time tables, so as to be helpful to my\r\nhusband.  I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study\r\nof the time tables now.  I knew that if anything were to take us to\r\nCastle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through\r\nBucharest, so I learned the times very carefully.  Unhappily there are\r\nnot many to learn, as the only train tomorrow leaves as I say."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Wonderful woman!" murmured the Professor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Can''t we get a special?" asked Lord Godalming.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVan Helsing shook his head, "I fear not.  This land is very different\r\nfrom yours or mine.  Even if we did have a special, it would probably\r\nnot arrive as soon as our regular train.  Moreover, we have something\r\nto prepare.  We must think.  Now let us organize.  You, friend Arthur,\r\ngo to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for\r\nus to go in the morning.  Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of\r\nthe ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz, with\r\nauthority to make a search of the ship just as it was here.  Quincey\r\nMorris, you see the Vice Consul, and get his aid with his fellow in\r\nGalatz and all he can do to make our way smooth, so that no times be\r\nlost when over the Danube.  John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and\r\nwe shall consult.  For so if time be long you may be delayed.  And it\r\nwill not matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make\r\nreport."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And I," said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than\r\nshe had been for many a long day, "shall try to be of use in all ways,\r\nand shall think and write for you as I used to do.  Something is\r\nshifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have\r\nbeen of late!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to\r\nrealize the significance of her words.  But Van Helsing and I, turning\r\nto each other, met each a grave and troubled glance.  We said nothing\r\nat the time, however.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.\r\nHarker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of\r\nHarker''s journal at the Castle.  She went away to get it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the door was shut upon her he said to me, "We mean the same!\r\nSpeak out!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Here is some change.  It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may\r\ndeceive us."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Quite so.  Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No!" said I, "unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me\r\nalone."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You are in part right, friend John, but only in part.  I want to tell\r\nyou something.  And oh, my friend, I am taking a great, a terrible,\r\nrisk.  But I believe it is right.  In the moment when Madam Mina said\r\nthose words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to\r\nme.  In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to\r\nread her mind.  Or more like he took her to see him in his earth box\r\nin the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of\r\nsun.  He learn then that we are here, for she have more to tell in her\r\nopen life with eyes to see ears to hear than he, shut as he is, in his\r\ncoffin box.  Now he make his most effort to escape us.  At present he\r\nwant her not.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his\r\ncall.  But he cut her off, take her, as he can do, out of his own\r\npower, that so she come not to him.  Ah!  There I have hope that our\r\nman brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the\r\ngrace of God, will come higher than his child-brain that lie in his\r\ntomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only\r\nwork selfish and therefore small.  Here comes Madam Mina.  Not a word\r\nto her of her trance!  She knows it not, and it would overwhelm her\r\nand make despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage, when\r\nmost we want all her great brain which is trained like man''s brain,\r\nbut is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give\r\nher, and which he may not take away altogether, though he think not\r\nso.  Hush!  Let me speak, and you shall learn.  Oh, John, my friend,\r\nwe are in awful straits.  I fear, as I never feared before.  We can\r\nonly trust the good God.  Silence!  Here she comes!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI thought that the Professor was going to break down and have\r\nhysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he\r\ncontrolled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker\r\ntripped into the room, bright and happy looking and, in the doing of\r\nwork, seemingly forgetful of her misery.  As she came in, she handed a\r\nnumber of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing.  He looked over them\r\ngravely, his face brightening up as he read.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said, "Friend\r\nJohn, to you with so much experience already, and you too, dear Madam\r\nMina, that are young, here is a lesson.  Do not fear ever to think.  A\r\nhalf thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him\r\nloose his wings.  Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where\r\nthat half thought come from and I find that he be no half thought at\r\nall.  That be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet\r\nstrong to use his little wings.  Nay, like the ''Ugly Duck'' of my\r\nfriend Hans Andersen, he be no duck thought at all, but a big swan\r\nthought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to\r\ntry them.  See I read here what Jonathan have written.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought\r\nhis forces over The Great River into Turkey Land, who when he was\r\nbeaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come\r\nalone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,\r\nsince he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What does this tell us?  Not much?  No!  The Count''s child thought\r\nsee nothing, therefore he speak so free.  Your man thought see\r\nnothing.  My man thought see nothing, till just now.  No!  But there\r\ncomes another word from some one who speak without thought because\r\nshe, too, know not what it mean, what it might mean.  Just as there\r\nare elements which rest, yet when in nature''s course they move on\r\ntheir way and they touch, the pouf!  And there comes a flash of light,\r\nheaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some.  But that show up\r\nall earth below for leagues and leagues.  Is it not so?  Well, I shall\r\nexplain.  To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime?\r\n''Yes'' and ''No.''  You, John, yes, for it is a study of insanity.  You,\r\nno, Madam Mina, for crime touch you not, not but once.  Still, your\r\nmind works true, and argues not a particulari ad universale.  There is\r\nthis peculiarity in criminals.  It is so constant, in all countries\r\nand at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy,\r\ncome to know it empirically, that it is.  That is to be empiric.  The\r\ncriminal always work at one crime, that is the true criminal who seems\r\npredestinate to crime, and who will of none other.  This criminal has\r\nnot full man brain.  He is clever and cunning and resourceful, but he\r\nbe not of man stature as to brain.  He be of child brain in much.  Now\r\nthis criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also.  He, too, have\r\nchild brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done.  The\r\nlittle bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by\r\nprinciple, but empirically.  And when he learn to do, then there is to\r\nhim the ground to start from to do more.  ''Dos pou sto,'' said\r\nArchimedes.  ''Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!''  To do\r\nonce, is the fulcrum whereby child brain become man brain.  And until\r\nhe have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every\r\ntime, just as he have done before!  Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes\r\nare opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,"\r\nfor Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe went on, "Now you shall speak.  Tell us two dry men of science what\r\nyou see with those so bright eyes."  He took her hand and held it\r\nwhilst he spoke.  His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I\r\nthought instinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type.  Nordau and Lombroso\r\nwould so classify him, and qua criminal he is of an imperfectly formed\r\nmind.  Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit.  His\r\npast is a clue, and the one page of it that we know, and that from his\r\nown lips, tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call\r\na ''tight place,'' he went back to his own country from the land he had\r\ntried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself\r\nfor a new effort.  He came again better equipped for his work, and\r\nwon.  So he came to London to invade a new land.  He was beaten, and\r\nwhen all hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he\r\nfled back over the sea to his home.  Just as formerly he had fled back\r\nover the Danube from Turkey Land."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good, good!  Oh, you so clever lady!" said Van Helsing,\r\nenthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand.  A moment later\r\nhe said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick room\r\nconsultation, "Seventy-two only, and in all this excitement.  I have\r\nhope."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTurning to her again, he said with keen expectation, "But go on.  Go\r\non!  There is more to tell if you will.  Be not afraid.  John and I\r\nknow.  I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.  Speak,\r\nwithout fear!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I will try to.  But you will forgive me if I seem too egotistical."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Nay!  Fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Then, as he is criminal he is selfish.  And as his intellect is small\r\nand his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one\r\npurpose.  That purpose is remorseless.  As he fled back over the\r\nDanube, leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on\r\nbeing safe, careless of all.  So his own selfishness frees my soul\r\nsomewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that\r\ndreadful night.  I felt it!  Oh, I felt it!  Thank God, for His great\r\nmercy!  My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour.  And\r\nall that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have\r\nused my knowledge for his ends."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor stood up, "He has so used your mind, and by it he has\r\nleft us here in Varna, whilst the ship that carried him rushed through\r\nenveloping fog up to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation\r\nfor escaping from us.  But his child mind only saw so far.  And it may\r\nbe that as ever is in God''s Providence, the very thing that the evil\r\ndoer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his\r\nchiefest harm.  The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great\r\nPsalmist says.  For now that he think he is free from every trace of\r\nus all, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his\r\nselfish child brain will whisper him to sleep.  He think, too, that as\r\nhe cut himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge\r\nof him to you.  There is where he fail!  That terrible baptism of\r\nblood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you\r\nhave as yet done in your times of freedom, when the sun rise and set.\r\nAt such times you go by my volition and not by his.  And this power to\r\ngood of you and others, you have won from your suffering at his hands.\r\nThis is now all more precious that he know it not, and to guard\r\nhimself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where.\r\nWe, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us\r\nthrough all this blackness, and these many dark hours.  We shall\r\nfollow him, and we shall not flinch, even if we peril ourselves that\r\nwe become like him.  Friend John, this has been a great hour, and it\r\nhave done much to advance us on our way.  You must be scribe and write\r\nhim all down, so that when the others return from their work you can\r\ngive it to them, then they shall know as we do."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker\r\nhas written with the typewriter all since she brought the MS to us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 align="center">\r\nCHAPTER 26\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 align="center">\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n29 October.--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz.  Last\r\nnight we all assembled a little before the time of sunset.  Each of us\r\nhad done his work as well as he could, so far as thought, and\r\nendeavour, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our\r\njourney, and for our work when we get to Galatz.  When the usual time\r\ncame round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort, and\r\nafter a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than\r\nhas been usually necessary, she sank into the trance.  Usually she\r\nspeaks on a hint, but this time the Professor had to ask her\r\nquestions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn\r\nanything.  At last her answer came.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I can see nothing.  We are still.  There are no waves lapping, but\r\nonly a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser.  I can\r\nhear men''s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of\r\noars in the rowlocks.  A gun is fired somewhere, the echo of it seems\r\nfar away.  There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains\r\nare dragged along.  What is this?  There is a gleam of light.  I can\r\nfeel the air blowing upon me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere she stopped.  She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she\r\nlay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if\r\nlifting a weight.  Van Helsing and I looked at each other with\r\nunderstanding.  Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her\r\nintently, whilst Harker''s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of\r\nhis Kukri.  There was a long pause.  We all knew that the time when\r\nshe could speak was passing, but we felt that it was useless to say\r\nanything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly she sat up, and as she opened her eyes said sweetly, "Would\r\nnone of you like a cup of tea?  You must all be so tired!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe could only make her happy, and so acqueisced.  She bustled off to\r\nget tea.  When she had gone Van Helsing said, "You see, my friends.  He\r\nis close to land.  He has left his earth chest.  But he has yet to get\r\non shore.  In the night he may lie hidden somewhere, but if he be not\r\ncarried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve\r\nthe land.  In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form\r\nand jump or fly on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape.\r\nAnd if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box\r\ncontain.  Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore tonight, or before\r\ndawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.  We may then arrive in\r\ntime.  For if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime,\r\nboxed up and at our mercy.  For he dare not be his true self, awake\r\nand visible, lest he be discovered."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn,\r\nat which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEarly this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her\r\nresponse in her trance.  The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming\r\nthan before, and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise\r\nwas so short that we began to despair.  Van Helsing seemed to throw\r\nhis whole soul into the effort.  At last, in obedience to his will she\r\nmade reply.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"All is dark.  I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking\r\nas of wood on wood."  She paused, and the red sun shot up.  We must\r\nwait till tonight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of\r\nexpectation.  We are due to arrive between two and three in the\r\nmorning.  But already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we\r\ncannot possibly get in till well after sunup.  Thus we shall have two\r\nmore hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker!  Either or both may possibly\r\nthrow more light on what is happening.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Sunset has come and gone.  Fortunately it came at a time when\r\nthere was no distraction.  For had it occurred whilst we were at a\r\nstation, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.\r\nMrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than\r\nthis morning.  I am in fear that her power of reading the Count''s\r\nsensations may die away, just when we want it most.  It seems to me\r\nthat her imagination is beginning to work.  Whilst she has been in the\r\ntrance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts.  If\r\nthis goes on it may ultimately mislead us.  If I thought that the\r\nCount''s power over her would die away equally with her power of\r\nknowledge it would be a happy thought.  But I am afraid that it may\r\nnot be so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she did speak, her words were enigmatical, "Something is going\r\nout.  I can feel it pass me like a cold wind.  I can hear, far off,\r\nconfused sounds, as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce falling\r\nwater, and the howling of wolves."  She stopped and a shudder ran\r\nthrough her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till at the\r\nend, she shook as though in a palsy.  She said no more, even in answer\r\nto the Professor''s imperative questioning.  When she woke from the\r\ntrance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid, but her mind was all\r\nalert.  She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said.\r\nWhen she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in\r\nsilence.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October, 7 A.M.--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to\r\nwrite later.  Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.\r\nKnowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,\r\nVan Helsing began his passes earlier than usual.  They produced no\r\neffect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still\r\ngreater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose.  The Professor\r\nlost no time in his questioning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer answer came with equal quickness, "All is dark.  I hear water\r\nswirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood.\r\nCattle low far off.  There is another sound, a queer one like&#8230;"\r\nShe stopped and grew white, and whiter still.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Go on, go on!  Speak, I command you!" said Van Helsing in an agonized\r\nvoice.  At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen\r\nsun was reddening even Mrs. Harker''s pale face.  She opened her eyes,\r\nand we all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost\r\nunconcern.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can''t?  I don''t\r\nremember anything."  Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces,\r\nshe said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look, "What\r\nhave I said?  What have I done?  I know nothing, only that I was lying\r\nhere, half asleep, and heard you say ''go on! speak, I command you!''  It\r\nseemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, sadly, "it is proof, if proof be needed, of\r\nhow I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more\r\nearnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom\r\nI am proud to obey!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe whistles are sounding.  We are nearing Galatz.  We are on fire\r\nwith anxiety and eagerness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October.--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been\r\nordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since\r\nhe does not speak any foreign language.  The forces were distributed\r\nmuch as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the\r\nVice Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some\r\nsort to the official, we being in extreme hurry.  Jonathan and the two\r\ndoctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival\r\nof the Czarina Catherine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Lord Godalming has returned.  The Consul is away, and the Vice\r\nConsul sick.  So the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.  He\r\nwas very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October.--At nine o''clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called\r\non Messrs. Mackenzie &amp; Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of\r\nHapgood.  They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord\r\nGodalming''s telegraphed request, asking them to show us any civility\r\nin their power.  They were more than kind and courteous, and took us\r\nat once on board the Czarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the\r\nriver harbor.  There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us\r\nof his voyage.  He said that in all his life he had never had so\r\nfavourable a run.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Man!" he said, "but it made us afeard, for we expect it that we\r\nshould have to pay for it wi'' some rare piece o'' ill luck, so as to\r\nkeep up the average.  It''s no canny to run frae London to the Black\r\nSea wi'' a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin'' on\r\nyer sail for his ain purpose.  An'' a'' the time we could no speer a\r\nthing.  Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell\r\non us and travelled wi'' us, till when after it had lifted and we\r\nlooked out, the deil a thing could we see.  We ran by Gibraltar wi''\r\noot bein'' able to signal.  An'' til we came to the Dardanelles and had\r\nto wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o''\r\naught.  At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the\r\nfog was lifted.  But whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to\r\nget us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would\r\nor no.  If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit\r\nwi'' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic, an'' the Old Mon who had\r\nserved his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin''\r\nhim."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial\r\nreasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said, "Mine friend, that Devil is\r\nmore clever than he is thought by some, and he know when he meet his\r\nmatch!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on, "When\r\nwe got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble.  Some o'' them, the\r\nRoumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had\r\nbeen put on board by a queer lookin'' old man just before we had\r\nstarted frae London.  I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out\r\ntheir twa fingers when they saw him, to guard them against the evil\r\neye.  Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly\r\nrideeculous!  I sent them aboot their business pretty quick, but as\r\njust after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent\r\nsomething, though I wouldn''t say it was again the big box.  Well, on\r\nwe went, and as the fog didn''t let up for five days I joost let the\r\nwind carry us, for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres, well, he\r\nwould fetch it up a''reet.  An'' if he didn''t, well, we''d keep a sharp\r\nlookout anyhow.  Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the\r\ntime.  And two days ago, when the mornin'' sun came through the fog, we\r\nfound ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.  The Roumanians\r\nwere wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling\r\nit in the river.  I had to argy wi'' them aboot it wi'' a handspike.  An''\r\nwhen the last o'' them rose off the deck wi'' his head in his hand, I\r\nhad convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the\r\ntrust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube.\r\nThey had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as\r\nit was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I''d let it lie till we\r\ndischarged in the port an'' get rid o''t althegither.  We didn''t do much\r\nclearin'' that day, an'' had to remain the nicht at anchor.  But in the\r\nmornin'', braw an'' airly, an hour before sunup, a man came aboard wi''\r\nan order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one\r\nCount Dracula.  Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand.  He\r\nhad his papers a'' reet, an'' glad I was to be rid o'' the dam'' thing,\r\nfor I was beginnin'' masel'' to feel uneasy at it.  If the Deil did have\r\nany luggage aboord the ship, I''m thinkin'' it was nane ither than that\r\nsame!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What was the name of the man who took it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing with\r\nrestrained eagerness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I''ll be tellin'' ye quick!" he answered, and stepping down to his\r\ncabin, produced a receipt signed "Immanuel Hildesheim."  Burgen-strasse\r\n16 was the address.  We found out that this was all the Captain knew,\r\nso with thanks we came away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi\r\nTheatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez.  His arguments were\r\npointed with specie, we doing the punctuation, and with a little\r\nbargaining he told us what he knew.  This turned out to be simple but\r\nimportant.  He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London,\r\ntelling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid\r\ncustoms, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine.\r\nThis he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt\r\nwith the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port.  He had been\r\npaid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed\r\nfor gold at the Danube International Bank.  When Skinsky had come to\r\nhim, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to\r\nsave porterage.  That was all he knew.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him.  One of his\r\nneighbors, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he\r\nhad gone away two days before, no one knew whither.  This was\r\ncorroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of\r\nthe house together with the rent due, in English money.  This had been\r\nbetween ten and eleven o''clock last night.  We were at a standstill\r\nagain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out\r\nthat the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the\r\nchurchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if\r\nby some wild animal.  Those we had been speaking with ran off to see\r\nthe horror, the women crying out.  "This is the work of a Slovak!"  We\r\nhurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the\r\naffair, and so detained.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion.  We were\r\nall convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere, but\r\nwhere that might be we would have to discover.  With heavy hearts we\r\ncame home to the hotel to Mina.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina\r\nagain into our confidence.  Things are getting desperate, and it is at\r\nleast a chance, though a hazardous one.  As a preliminary step, I was\r\nreleased from my promise to her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October, evening.--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited\r\nthat there was nothing to be done till they had some rest, so I asked\r\nthem all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything\r\nup to the moment.  I feel so grateful to the man who invented the\r\n"Traveller''s" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for\r\nme.  I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write\r\nwith a pen&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is all done.  Poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,\r\nwhat he must be suffering now.  He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to\r\nbreathe, and his whole body appears in collapse.  His brows are knit.\r\nHis face is drawn with pain.  Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I\r\ncan see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his\r\nthoughts.  Oh! if I could only help at all.  I shall do what I can.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I\r\nhave not yet seen.  Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all\r\ncarefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion.  I shall try\r\nto follow the Professor''s example, and think without prejudice on the\r\nfacts before me&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI do believe that under God''s providence I have made a discovery.  I\r\nshall get the maps and look over them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am more than ever sure that I am right.  My new conclusion is ready,\r\nso I shall get our party together and read it.  They can judge it.  It\r\nis well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S MEMORANDUM\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(ENTERED IN HER JOURNAL)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGround of inquiry.--Count Dracula''s problem is to get back\r\nto his own place.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(a) He must be brought back by some one.  This is evident;\r\nfor had he power to move himself as he wished he could go\r\neither as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way.  He\r\nevidently fears discovery or interference, in the state of\r\nhelplessness in which he must be, confined as he is between\r\ndawn and sunset in his wooden box.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(b) How is he to be taken?--Here a process of exclusions may\r\nhelp us.  By road, by rail, by water?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1.  By Road.--There are endless difficulties, especially in\r\nleaving the city.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(x) There are people.  And people are curious, and\r\ninvestigate.  A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might\r\nbe in the box, would destroy him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers\r\nto pass.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(z) His pursuers might follow.  This is his highest fear.\r\nAnd in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled,\r\nso far as he can, even his victim, me!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2.  By Rail.--There is no one in charge of the box.  It\r\nwould have to take its chance of being delayed, and delay\r\nwould be fatal, with enemies on the track.  True, he might\r\nescape at night.  But what would he be, if left in a strange\r\nplace with no refuge that he could fly to?  This is not what he\r\nintends, and he does not mean to risk it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3.  By Water.--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but\r\nwith most danger in another.  On the water he is powerless\r\nexcept at night.  Even then he can only summon fog and storm and\r\nsnow and his wolves.  But were he wrecked, the living water would\r\nengulf him, helpless, and he would indeed be lost.  He could have\r\nthe vessel drive to land, but if it were unfriendly land, wherein\r\nhe was not free to move, his position would still be desperate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe know from the record that he was on the water, so what\r\nwe have to do is to ascertain what water.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first thing is to realize exactly what he has done as\r\nyet.  We may, then, get a light on what his task is to be.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFirstly.--We must differentiate between what he did in\r\nLondon as part of his general plan of action, when he was\r\npressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSecondly.--We must see, as well as we can surmise it from the\r\nfacts we know of, what he has done here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz,\r\nand sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain\r\nhis means of exit from England.  His immediate and sole purpose\r\nthen was to escape.  The proof of this, is the letter of\r\ninstructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away\r\nthe box before sunrise.  There is also the instruction to Petrof\r\nSkinsky.  These we must only guess at, but there must have been\r\nsome letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat, so far, his plans were successful we know.  The Czarina\r\nCatherine made a phenomenally quick journey.  So much so that\r\nCaptain Donelson''s suspicions were aroused.  But his superstition\r\nunited with his canniness played the Count''s game for him, and he\r\nran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought\r\nup blindfold at Galatz.  That the Count''s arrangements were well\r\nmade, has been proved.  Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off,\r\nand gave it to Skinsky.  Skinsky took it, and here we lose the\r\ntrail.  We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,\r\nmoving along.  The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have\r\nbeen avoided.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow we come to what the Count must have done after his\r\narrival, on land, at Galatz.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe box was given to Skinsky before sunrise.  At sunrise\r\nthe Count could appear in his own form.  Here, we ask why\r\nSkinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work?  In my husband''s\r\ndiary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade\r\ndown the river to the port.  And the man''s remark, that the\r\nmurder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling\r\nagainst his class.  The Count wanted isolation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy surmise is this, that in London the Count decided to get\r\nback to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret\r\nway.  He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they\r\ndelivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for\r\nthere they were shipped to London.  Thus the Count had knowledge\r\nof the persons who could arrange this service.  When the box was\r\non land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his\r\nbox, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging\r\nthe carriage of the box up some river.  When this was done, and\r\nhe knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he\r\nthought, by murdering his agent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have examined the map and find that the river most\r\nsuitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the\r\nPruth or the Sereth.  I read in the typescript that in my\r\ntrance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my\r\nears and the creaking of wood.  The Count in his box, then,\r\nwas on a river in an open boat, propelled probably either\r\nby oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working\r\nagainst stream.  There would be no such if floating down\r\nstream.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but\r\nwe may possibly investigate further.  Now of these two, the\r\nPruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at\r\nFundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo\r\nPass.  The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula''s\r\ncastle as can be got by water.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL--CONTINUED\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me.\r\nThe others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said,\r\n"Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher.  Her eyes have been\r\nwhere we were blinded.  Now we are on the track once again, and this\r\ntime we may succeed.  Our enemy is at his most helpless.  And if we\r\ncan come on him by day, on the water, our task will be over.  He has a\r\nstart, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave this box\r\nlest those who carry him may suspect.  For them to suspect would be to\r\nprompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish.  This he\r\nknows, and will not.  Now men, to our Council of War, for here and\r\nnow, we must plan what each and all shall do."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I shall get a steam launch and follow him," said Lord Godalming.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land," said Mr.\r\nMorris.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good!" said the Professor, "both good.  But neither must go alone.\r\nThere must be force to overcome force if need be.  The Slovak is\r\nstrong and rough, and he carries rude arms."  All the men smiled, for\r\namongst them they carried a small arsenal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSaid Mr. Morris, "I have brought some Winchesters.  They are pretty\r\nhandy in a crowd, and there may be wolves.  The Count, if you\r\nremember, took some other precautions.  He made some requisitions on\r\nothers that Mrs. Harker could not quite hear or understand.  We must\r\nbe ready at all points."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Seward said, "I think I had better go with Quincey.  We have been\r\naccustomed to hunt together, and we two, well armed, will be a match\r\nfor whatever may come along.  You must not be alone, Art.  It may be\r\nnecessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust, for I don''t\r\nsuppose these fellows carry guns, would undo all our plans.  There\r\nmust be no chances, this time.  We shall not rest until the Count''s\r\nhead and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot\r\nreincarnate."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me.  I could\r\nsee that the poor dear was torn about in his mind.  Of course he\r\nwanted to be with me.  But then the boat service would, most likely,\r\nbe the one which would destroy the&#8230; the&#8230; Vampire.  (Why did\r\nI hesitate to write the word?)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke,\r\n"Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons.  First, because\r\nyou are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed\r\nat the last.  And again that it is your right to destroy him.  That,\r\nwhich has wrought such woe to you and yours.  Be not afraid for Madam\r\nMina.  She will be my care, if I may.  I am old.  My legs are not so\r\nquick to run as once.  And I am not used to ride so long or to pursue\r\nas need be, or to fight with lethal weapons.  But I can be of other\r\nservice.  I can fight in other way.  And I can die, if need be, as\r\nwell as younger men.  Now let me say that what I would is this.  While\r\nyou, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little\r\nsteamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank\r\nwhere perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into\r\nthe heart of the enemy''s country.  Whilst the old fox is tied in his\r\nbox, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land,\r\nwhere he dares not raise the lid of his coffin box lest his Slovak\r\ncarriers should in fear leave him to perish, we shall go in the track\r\nwhere Jonathan went, from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to\r\nthe Castle of Dracula.  Here, Madam Mina''s hypnotic power will surely\r\nhelp, and we shall find our way, all dark and unknown otherwise, after\r\nthe first sunrise when we are near that fateful place.  There is much\r\nto be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of\r\nvipers be obliterated."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere Jonathan interrupted him hotly, "Do you mean to say, Professor\r\nVan Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her sad case and tainted as\r\nshe is with that devil''s illness, right into the jaws of his\r\ndeathtrap?  Not for the world!  Not for Heaven or Hell!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on, "Do you\r\nknow what the place is?  Have you seen that awful den of hellish\r\ninfamy, with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every\r\nspeck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?\r\nHave you felt the Vampire''s lips upon your throat?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up\r\nhis arms with a cry, "Oh, my God, what have we done to have this\r\nterror upon us?" and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor''s voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed\r\nto vibrate in the air, calmed us all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful\r\nplace that I would go.  God forbid that I should take her into that\r\nplace.  There is work, wild work, to be done before that place can be\r\npurify.  Remember that we are in terrible straits.  If the Count\r\nescape us this time, and he is strong and subtle and cunning, he may\r\nchoose to sleep him for a century, and then in time our dear one," he\r\ntook my hand, "would come to him to keep him company, and would be as\r\nthose others that you, Jonathan, saw.  You have told us of their\r\ngloating lips.  You heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the\r\nmoving bag that the Count threw to them.  You shudder, and well may it\r\nbe.  Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is necessary.  My\r\nfriend, is it not a dire need for that which I am giving, possibly my\r\nlife?  If it were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I\r\nwho would have to go to keep them company."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do as you will," said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over,\r\n"we are in the hands of God!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.\r\nHow can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true,\r\nand so brave!  And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of\r\nmoney!  What can it not do when basely used.  I felt so thankful that\r\nLord Godalming is rich, and both he and Mr. Morris, who also has\r\nplenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely.  For if they did\r\nnot, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so\r\nwell equipped, as it will within another hour.  It is not three hours\r\nsince it was arranged what part each of us was to do.  And now Lord\r\nGodalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready\r\nto start at a moment''s notice.  Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a\r\ndozen good horses, well appointed.  We have all the maps and\r\nappliances of various kinds that can be had.  Professor Van Helsing\r\nand I are to leave by the 11:40 train tonight for Veresti, where we\r\nare to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.  We are bringing a\r\ngood deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses.  We\r\nshall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the\r\nmatter.  The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so\r\nwe shall get on all right.  We have all got arms, even for me a large\r\nbore revolver.  Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like\r\nthe rest.  Alas!  I cannot carry one arm that the rest do, the scar on\r\nmy forehead forbids that.  Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling\r\nme that I am fully armed as there may be wolves.  The weather is\r\ngetting colder every hour, and there are snow flurries which come and\r\ngo as warnings.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--It took all my courage to say goodbye to my darling.  We may\r\nnever meet again.  Courage, Mina!  The Professor is looking at you\r\nkeenly.  His look is a warning.  There must be no tears now, unless it\r\nmay be that God will let them fall in gladness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October, night.--I am writing this in the light from the furnace\r\ndoor of the steam launch.  Lord Godalming is firing up.  He is an\r\nexperienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his\r\nown on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads.  Regarding our\r\nplans, we finally decided that Mina''s guess was correct, and that if\r\nany waterway was chosen for the Count''s escape back to his Castle, the\r\nSereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one.  We\r\ntook it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would\r\nbe the place chosen for crossing the country between the river and the\r\nCarpathians.  We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at\r\nnight.  There is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart\r\nto make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough.  Lord Godalming tells\r\nme to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be\r\non watch.  But I cannot sleep, how can I with the terrible danger\r\nhanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy only comfort is that we are in the hands of God.  Only for that\r\nfaith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all\r\nthe trouble.  Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride\r\nbefore we started.  They are to keep up the right bank, far enough off\r\nto get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and\r\navoid the following of its curves.  They have, for the first stages,\r\ntwo men to ride and lead their spare horses, four in all, so as not to\r\nexcite curiosity.  When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly,\r\nthey shall themselves look after the horses.  It may be necessary for\r\nus to join forces.  If so they can mount our whole party.  One of the\r\nsaddles has a moveable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if\r\nrequired.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is a wild adventure we are on.  Here, as we are rushing along\r\nthrough the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up\r\nand strike us, with all the mysterious voices of the night around us,\r\nit all comes home.  We seem to be drifting into unknown places and\r\nunknown ways.  Into a whole world of dark and dreadful things.\r\nGodalming is shutting the furnace door&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n31 October.--Still hurrying along.  The day has come, and Godalming is\r\nsleeping.  I am on watch.  The morning is bitterly cold, the furnace\r\nheat is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats.  As yet we have\r\npassed only a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or\r\npackage of anything like the size of the one we seek.  The men were\r\nscared every time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on\r\ntheir knees and prayed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 November, evening.--No news all day.  We have found nothing of the\r\nkind we seek.  We have now passed into the Bistritza, and if we are\r\nwrong in our surmise our chance is gone.  We have overhauled every\r\nboat, big and little.  Early this morning, one crew took us for a\r\nGovernment boat, and treated us accordingly.  We saw in this a way of\r\nsmoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the\r\nSereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously.  With\r\nevery boat which we have overhauled since then this trick has\r\nsucceeded.  We have had every deference shown to us, and not once any\r\nobjection to whatever we chose to ask or do.  Some of the Slovaks tell\r\nus that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she\r\nhad a double crew on board.  This was before they came to Fundu, so\r\nthey could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or\r\ncontinued on up the Sereth.  At Fundu we could not hear of any such\r\nboat, so she must have passed there in the night.  I am feeling very\r\nsleepy.  The cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature\r\nmust have rest some time.  Godalming insists that he shall keep the\r\nfirst watch.  God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and\r\nme.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 November, morning.--It is broad daylight.  That good fellow would\r\nnot wake me.  He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept\r\npeacefully and was forgetting my trouble.  It seems brutally selfish\r\nto me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night, but he was\r\nquite right.  I am a new man this morning.  And, as I sit here and\r\nwatch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding\r\nthe engine, steering, and keeping watch.  I can feel that my strength\r\nand energy are coming back to me.  I wonder where Mina is now, and Van\r\nHelsing.  They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday.  It\r\nwould take them some time to get the carriage and horses.  So if they\r\nhad started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo\r\nPass.  God guide and help them!  I am afraid to think what may\r\nhappen.  If we could only go faster.  But we cannot.  The engines are\r\nthrobbing and doing their utmost.  I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr.\r\nMorris are getting on.  There seem to be endless streams running down\r\nthe mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large, at\r\npresent, at all events, though they are doubtless terrible in winter\r\nand when the snow melts, the horsemen may not have met much\r\nobstruction.  I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them.\r\nFor if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be\r\nnecessary to take counsel together what to do next.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 November.--Three days on the road.  No news, and no time to write it\r\nif there had been, for every moment is precious.  We have had only the\r\nrest needful for the horses.  But we are both bearing it wonderfully.\r\nThose adventurous days of ours are turning up useful.  We must push\r\non.  We shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3 November.--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the\r\nBistritza.  I wish it wasn''t so cold.  There are signs of snow coming.\r\nAnd if it falls heavy it will stop us.  In such case we must get a\r\nsledge and go on, Russian fashion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n4 November.--Today we heard of the launch having been detained by an\r\naccident when trying to force a way up the rapids.  The Slovak boats\r\nget up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge.  Some\r\nwent up only a few hours before.  Godalming is an amateur fitter\r\nhimself, and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off\r\non the chase afresh.  I fear that the boat is not any better for the\r\naccident, the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water\r\nagain, she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in\r\nsight.  We must push on harder than ever.  Our help may be wanted\r\nsoon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n31 October.--Arrived at Veresti at noon.  The Professor tells me that\r\nthis morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotize me at all, and that all\r\nI could say was, "dark and quiet."  He is off now buying a carriage\r\nand horses.  He says that he will later on try to buy additional\r\nhorses, so that we may be able to change them on the way.  We have\r\nsomething more than 70 miles before us.  The country is lovely, and\r\nmost interesting.  If only we were under different conditions, how\r\ndelightful it would be to see it all.  If Jonathan and I were driving\r\nthrough it alone what a pleasure it would be.  To stop and see people,\r\nand learn something of their life, and to fill our minds and memories\r\nwith all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful\r\ncountry and the quaint people!  But, alas!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Dr. Van Helsing has returned.  He has got the carriage and\r\nhorses.  We are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour.  The\r\nlandlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions.  It seems\r\nenough for a company of soldiers.  The Professor encourages her, and\r\nwhispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any food again.\r\nHe has been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of\r\nfur coats and wraps, and all sorts of warm things.  There will not be\r\nany chance of our being cold.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe shall soon be off.  I am afraid to think what may happen to us.  We\r\nare truly in the hands of God.  He alone knows what may be, and I pray\r\nHim, with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will\r\nwatch over my beloved husband.  That whatever may happen, Jonathan may\r\nknow that I loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my\r\nlatest and truest thought will be always for him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n29 October.--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz.  Last\r\nnight we all assembled a little before the time of sunset.  Each of us\r\nhad done his work as well as he could, so far as thought, and\r\nendeavour, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our\r\njourney, and for our work when we get to Galatz.  When the usual time\r\ncame round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort, and\r\nafter a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than\r\nhas been usually necessary, she sank into the trance.  Usually she\r\nspeaks on a hint, but this time the Professor had to ask her\r\nquestions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn\r\nanything.  At last her answer came.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I can see nothing.  We are still.  There are no waves lapping, but\r\nonly a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser.  I can\r\nhear men''s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of\r\noars in the rowlocks.  A gun is fired somewhere, the echo of it seems\r\nfar away.  There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains\r\nare dragged along.  What is this?  There is a gleam of light.  I can\r\nfeel the air blowing upon me."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere she stopped.  She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she\r\nlay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if\r\nlifting a weight.  Van Helsing and I looked at each other with\r\nunderstanding.  Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her\r\nintently, whilst Harker''s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of\r\nhis Kukri.  There was a long pause.  We all knew that the time when\r\nshe could speak was passing, but we felt that it was useless to say\r\nanything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly she sat up, and as she opened her eyes said sweetly, "Would\r\nnone of you like a cup of tea?  You must all be so tired!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe could only make her happy, and so acqueisced.  She bustled off to\r\nget tea.  When she had gone Van Helsing said, "You see, my friends.  He\r\nis close to land.  He has left his earth chest.  But he has yet to get\r\non shore.  In the night he may lie hidden somewhere, but if he be not\r\ncarried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve\r\nthe land.  In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form\r\nand jump or fly on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape.\r\nAnd if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box\r\ncontain.  Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore tonight, or before\r\ndawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.  We may then arrive in\r\ntime.  For if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime,\r\nboxed up and at our mercy.  For he dare not be his true self, awake\r\nand visible, lest he be discovered."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn,\r\nat which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEarly this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her\r\nresponse in her trance.  The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming\r\nthan before, and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise\r\nwas so short that we began to despair.  Van Helsing seemed to throw\r\nhis whole soul into the effort.  At last, in obedience to his will she\r\nmade reply.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"All is dark.  I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking\r\nas of wood on wood."  She paused, and the red sun shot up.  We must\r\nwait till tonight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of\r\nexpectation.  We are due to arrive between two and three in the\r\nmorning.  But already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we\r\ncannot possibly get in till well after sunup.  Thus we shall have two\r\nmore hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker!  Either or both may possibly\r\nthrow more light on what is happening.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Sunset has come and gone.  Fortunately it came at a time when\r\nthere was no distraction.  For had it occurred whilst we were at a\r\nstation, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.\r\nMrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than\r\nthis morning.  I am in fear that her power of reading the Count''s\r\nsensations may die away, just when we want it most.  It seems to me\r\nthat her imagination is beginning to work.  Whilst she has been in the\r\ntrance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts.  If\r\nthis goes on it may ultimately mislead us.  If I thought that the\r\nCount''s power over her would die away equally with her power of\r\nknowledge it would be a happy thought.  But I am afraid that it may\r\nnot be so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she did speak, her words were enigmatical, "Something is going\r\nout.  I can feel it pass me like a cold wind.  I can hear, far off,\r\nconfused sounds, as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce falling\r\nwater, and the howling of wolves."  She stopped and a shudder ran\r\nthrough her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till at the\r\nend, she shook as though in a palsy.  She said no more, even in answer\r\nto the Professor''s imperative questioning.  When she woke from the\r\ntrance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid, but her mind was all\r\nalert.  She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said.\r\nWhen she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in\r\nsilence.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October, 7 A.M.--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to\r\nwrite later.  Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.\r\nKnowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,\r\nVan Helsing began his passes earlier than usual.  They produced no\r\neffect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still\r\ngreater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose.  The Professor\r\nlost no time in his questioning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer answer came with equal quickness, "All is dark.  I hear water\r\nswirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood.\r\nCattle low far off.  There is another sound, a queer one like&#8230;"\r\nShe stopped and grew white, and whiter still.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Go on, go on!  Speak, I command you!" said Van Helsing in an agonized\r\nvoice.  At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen\r\nsun was reddening even Mrs. Harker''s pale face.  She opened her eyes,\r\nand we all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost\r\nunconcern.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can''t?  I don''t\r\nremember anything."  Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces,\r\nshe said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look, "What\r\nhave I said?  What have I done?  I know nothing, only that I was lying\r\nhere, half asleep, and heard you say ''go on! speak, I command you!''  It\r\nseemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, sadly, "it is proof, if proof be needed, of\r\nhow I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more\r\nearnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom\r\nI am proud to obey!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe whistles are sounding.  We are nearing Galatz.  We are on fire\r\nwith anxiety and eagerness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October.--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been\r\nordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since\r\nhe does not speak any foreign language.  The forces were distributed\r\nmuch as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the\r\nVice Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some\r\nsort to the official, we being in extreme hurry.  Jonathan and the two\r\ndoctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival\r\nof the Czarina Catherine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Lord Godalming has returned.  The Consul is away, and the Vice\r\nConsul sick.  So the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.  He\r\nwas very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October.--At nine o''clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called\r\non Messrs. Mackenzie &amp; Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of\r\nHapgood.  They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord\r\nGodalming''s telegraphed request, asking them to show us any civility\r\nin their power.  They were more than kind and courteous, and took us\r\nat once on board the Czarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the\r\nriver harbor.  There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us\r\nof his voyage.  He said that in all his life he had never had so\r\nfavourable a run.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Man!" he said, "but it made us afeard, for we expect it that we\r\nshould have to pay for it wi'' some rare piece o'' ill luck, so as to\r\nkeep up the average.  It''s no canny to run frae London to the Black\r\nSea wi'' a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin'' on\r\nyer sail for his ain purpose.  An'' a'' the time we could no speer a\r\nthing.  Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell\r\non us and travelled wi'' us, till when after it had lifted and we\r\nlooked out, the deil a thing could we see.  We ran by Gibraltar wi''\r\noot bein'' able to signal.  An'' til we came to the Dardanelles and had\r\nto wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o''\r\naught.  At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the\r\nfog was lifted.  But whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to\r\nget us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would\r\nor no.  If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit\r\nwi'' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic, an'' the Old Mon who had\r\nserved his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin''\r\nhim."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial\r\nreasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said, "Mine friend, that Devil is\r\nmore clever than he is thought by some, and he know when he meet his\r\nmatch!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on, "When\r\nwe got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble.  Some o'' them, the\r\nRoumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had\r\nbeen put on board by a queer lookin'' old man just before we had\r\nstarted frae London.  I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out\r\ntheir twa fingers when they saw him, to guard them against the evil\r\neye.  Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly\r\nrideeculous!  I sent them aboot their business pretty quick, but as\r\njust after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent\r\nsomething, though I wouldn''t say it was again the big box.  Well, on\r\nwe went, and as the fog didn''t let up for five days I joost let the\r\nwind carry us, for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres, well, he\r\nwould fetch it up a''reet.  An'' if he didn''t, well, we''d keep a sharp\r\nlookout anyhow.  Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the\r\ntime.  And two days ago, when the mornin'' sun came through the fog, we\r\nfound ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.  The Roumanians\r\nwere wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling\r\nit in the river.  I had to argy wi'' them aboot it wi'' a handspike.  An''\r\nwhen the last o'' them rose off the deck wi'' his head in his hand, I\r\nhad convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the\r\ntrust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube.\r\nThey had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as\r\nit was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I''d let it lie till we\r\ndischarged in the port an'' get rid o''t althegither.  We didn''t do much\r\nclearin'' that day, an'' had to remain the nicht at anchor.  But in the\r\nmornin'', braw an'' airly, an hour before sunup, a man came aboard wi''\r\nan order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one\r\nCount Dracula.  Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand.  He\r\nhad his papers a'' reet, an'' glad I was to be rid o'' the dam'' thing,\r\nfor I was beginnin'' masel'' to feel uneasy at it.  If the Deil did have\r\nany luggage aboord the ship, I''m thinkin'' it was nane ither than that\r\nsame!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"What was the name of the man who took it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing with\r\nrestrained eagerness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I''ll be tellin'' ye quick!" he answered, and stepping down to his\r\ncabin, produced a receipt signed "Immanuel Hildesheim."  Burgen-strasse\r\n16 was the address.  We found out that this was all the Captain knew,\r\nso with thanks we came away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi\r\nTheatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez.  His arguments were\r\npointed with specie, we doing the punctuation, and with a little\r\nbargaining he told us what he knew.  This turned out to be simple but\r\nimportant.  He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London,\r\ntelling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid\r\ncustoms, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine.\r\nThis he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt\r\nwith the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port.  He had been\r\npaid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed\r\nfor gold at the Danube International Bank.  When Skinsky had come to\r\nhim, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to\r\nsave porterage.  That was all he knew.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him.  One of his\r\nneighbors, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he\r\nhad gone away two days before, no one knew whither.  This was\r\ncorroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of\r\nthe house together with the rent due, in English money.  This had been\r\nbetween ten and eleven o''clock last night.  We were at a standstill\r\nagain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out\r\nthat the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the\r\nchurchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if\r\nby some wild animal.  Those we had been speaking with ran off to see\r\nthe horror, the women crying out.  "This is the work of a Slovak!"  We\r\nhurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the\r\naffair, and so detained.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion.  We were\r\nall convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere, but\r\nwhere that might be we would have to discover.  With heavy hearts we\r\ncame home to the hotel to Mina.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina\r\nagain into our confidence.  Things are getting desperate, and it is at\r\nleast a chance, though a hazardous one.  As a preliminary step, I was\r\nreleased from my promise to her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October, evening.--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited\r\nthat there was nothing to be done till they had some rest, so I asked\r\nthem all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything\r\nup to the moment.  I feel so grateful to the man who invented the\r\n"Traveller''s" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for\r\nme.  I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write\r\nwith a pen&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is all done.  Poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,\r\nwhat he must be suffering now.  He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to\r\nbreathe, and his whole body appears in collapse.  His brows are knit.\r\nHis face is drawn with pain.  Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I\r\ncan see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his\r\nthoughts.  Oh! if I could only help at all.  I shall do what I can.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I\r\nhave not yet seen.  Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all\r\ncarefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion.  I shall try\r\nto follow the Professor''s example, and think without prejudice on the\r\nfacts before me&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI do believe that under God''s providence I have made a discovery.  I\r\nshall get the maps and look over them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am more than ever sure that I am right.  My new conclusion is ready,\r\nso I shall get our party together and read it.  They can judge it.  It\r\nis well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S MEMORANDUM\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(ENTERED IN HER JOURNAL)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGround of inquiry.--Count Dracula''s problem is to get back\r\nto his own place.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(a) He must be brought back by some one.  This is evident;\r\nfor had he power to move himself as he wished he could go\r\neither as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way.  He\r\nevidently fears discovery or interference, in the state of\r\nhelplessness in which he must be, confined as he is between\r\ndawn and sunset in his wooden box.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(b) How is he to be taken?--Here a process of exclusions may\r\nhelp us.  By road, by rail, by water?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1.  By Road.--There are endless difficulties, especially in\r\nleaving the city.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(x) There are people.  And people are curious, and\r\ninvestigate.  A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might\r\nbe in the box, would destroy him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers\r\nto pass.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(z) His pursuers might follow.  This is his highest fear.\r\nAnd in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled,\r\nso far as he can, even his victim, me!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2.  By Rail.--There is no one in charge of the box.  It\r\nwould have to take its chance of being delayed, and delay\r\nwould be fatal, with enemies on the track.  True, he might\r\nescape at night.  But what would he be, if left in a strange\r\nplace with no refuge that he could fly to?  This is not what he\r\nintends, and he does not mean to risk it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3.  By Water.--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but\r\nwith most danger in another.  On the water he is powerless\r\nexcept at night.  Even then he can only summon fog and storm and\r\nsnow and his wolves.  But were he wrecked, the living water would\r\nengulf him, helpless, and he would indeed be lost.  He could have\r\nthe vessel drive to land, but if it were unfriendly land, wherein\r\nhe was not free to move, his position would still be desperate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe know from the record that he was on the water, so what\r\nwe have to do is to ascertain what water.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first thing is to realize exactly what he has done as\r\nyet.  We may, then, get a light on what his task is to be.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFirstly.--We must differentiate between what he did in\r\nLondon as part of his general plan of action, when he was\r\npressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSecondly.--We must see, as well as we can surmise it from the\r\nfacts we know of, what he has done here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz,\r\nand sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain\r\nhis means of exit from England.  His immediate and sole purpose\r\nthen was to escape.  The proof of this, is the letter of\r\ninstructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away\r\nthe box before sunrise.  There is also the instruction to Petrof\r\nSkinsky.  These we must only guess at, but there must have been\r\nsome letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat, so far, his plans were successful we know.  The Czarina\r\nCatherine made a phenomenally quick journey.  So much so that\r\nCaptain Donelson''s suspicions were aroused.  But his superstition\r\nunited with his canniness played the Count''s game for him, and he\r\nran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought\r\nup blindfold at Galatz.  That the Count''s arrangements were well\r\nmade, has been proved.  Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off,\r\nand gave it to Skinsky.  Skinsky took it, and here we lose the\r\ntrail.  We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,\r\nmoving along.  The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have\r\nbeen avoided.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow we come to what the Count must have done after his\r\narrival, on land, at Galatz.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe box was given to Skinsky before sunrise.  At sunrise\r\nthe Count could appear in his own form.  Here, we ask why\r\nSkinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work?  In my husband''s\r\ndiary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade\r\ndown the river to the port.  And the man''s remark, that the\r\nmurder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling\r\nagainst his class.  The Count wanted isolation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy surmise is this, that in London the Count decided to get\r\nback to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret\r\nway.  He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they\r\ndelivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for\r\nthere they were shipped to London.  Thus the Count had knowledge\r\nof the persons who could arrange this service.  When the box was\r\non land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his\r\nbox, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging\r\nthe carriage of the box up some river.  When this was done, and\r\nhe knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he\r\nthought, by murdering his agent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have examined the map and find that the river most\r\nsuitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the\r\nPruth or the Sereth.  I read in the typescript that in my\r\ntrance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my\r\nears and the creaking of wood.  The Count in his box, then,\r\nwas on a river in an open boat, propelled probably either\r\nby oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working\r\nagainst stream.  There would be no such if floating down\r\nstream.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but\r\nwe may possibly investigate further.  Now of these two, the\r\nPruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at\r\nFundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo\r\nPass.  The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula''s\r\ncastle as can be got by water.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL--CONTINUED\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me.\r\nThe others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said,\r\n"Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher.  Her eyes have been\r\nwhere we were blinded.  Now we are on the track once again, and this\r\ntime we may succeed.  Our enemy is at his most helpless.  And if we\r\ncan come on him by day, on the water, our task will be over.  He has a\r\nstart, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave this box\r\nlest those who carry him may suspect.  For them to suspect would be to\r\nprompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish.  This he\r\nknows, and will not.  Now men, to our Council of War, for here and\r\nnow, we must plan what each and all shall do."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I shall get a steam launch and follow him," said Lord Godalming.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land," said Mr.\r\nMorris.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Good!" said the Professor, "both good.  But neither must go alone.\r\nThere must be force to overcome force if need be.  The Slovak is\r\nstrong and rough, and he carries rude arms."  All the men smiled, for\r\namongst them they carried a small arsenal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSaid Mr. Morris, "I have brought some Winchesters.  They are pretty\r\nhandy in a crowd, and there may be wolves.  The Count, if you\r\nremember, took some other precautions.  He made some requisitions on\r\nothers that Mrs. Harker could not quite hear or understand.  We must\r\nbe ready at all points."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Seward said, "I think I had better go with Quincey.  We have been\r\naccustomed to hunt together, and we two, well armed, will be a match\r\nfor whatever may come along.  You must not be alone, Art.  It may be\r\nnecessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust, for I don''t\r\nsuppose these fellows carry guns, would undo all our plans.  There\r\nmust be no chances, this time.  We shall not rest until the Count''s\r\nhead and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot\r\nreincarnate."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me.  I could\r\nsee that the poor dear was torn about in his mind.  Of course he\r\nwanted to be with me.  But then the boat service would, most likely,\r\nbe the one which would destroy the&#8230; the&#8230; Vampire.  (Why did\r\nI hesitate to write the word?)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke,\r\n"Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons.  First, because\r\nyou are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed\r\nat the last.  And again that it is your right to destroy him.  That,\r\nwhich has wrought such woe to you and yours.  Be not afraid for Madam\r\nMina.  She will be my care, if I may.  I am old.  My legs are not so\r\nquick to run as once.  And I am not used to ride so long or to pursue\r\nas need be, or to fight with lethal weapons.  But I can be of other\r\nservice.  I can fight in other way.  And I can die, if need be, as\r\nwell as younger men.  Now let me say that what I would is this.  While\r\nyou, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little\r\nsteamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank\r\nwhere perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into\r\nthe heart of the enemy''s country.  Whilst the old fox is tied in his\r\nbox, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land,\r\nwhere he dares not raise the lid of his coffin box lest his Slovak\r\ncarriers should in fear leave him to perish, we shall go in the track\r\nwhere Jonathan went, from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to\r\nthe Castle of Dracula.  Here, Madam Mina''s hypnotic power will surely\r\nhelp, and we shall find our way, all dark and unknown otherwise, after\r\nthe first sunrise when we are near that fateful place.  There is much\r\nto be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of\r\nvipers be obliterated."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere Jonathan interrupted him hotly, "Do you mean to say, Professor\r\nVan Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her sad case and tainted as\r\nshe is with that devil''s illness, right into the jaws of his\r\ndeathtrap?  Not for the world!  Not for Heaven or Hell!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on, "Do you\r\nknow what the place is?  Have you seen that awful den of hellish\r\ninfamy, with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every\r\nspeck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?\r\nHave you felt the Vampire''s lips upon your throat?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up\r\nhis arms with a cry, "Oh, my God, what have we done to have this\r\nterror upon us?" and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Professor''s voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed\r\nto vibrate in the air, calmed us all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful\r\nplace that I would go.  God forbid that I should take her into that\r\nplace.  There is work, wild work, to be done before that place can be\r\npurify.  Remember that we are in terrible straits.  If the Count\r\nescape us this time, and he is strong and subtle and cunning, he may\r\nchoose to sleep him for a century, and then in time our dear one," he\r\ntook my hand, "would come to him to keep him company, and would be as\r\nthose others that you, Jonathan, saw.  You have told us of their\r\ngloating lips.  You heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the\r\nmoving bag that the Count threw to them.  You shudder, and well may it\r\nbe.  Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is necessary.  My\r\nfriend, is it not a dire need for that which I am giving, possibly my\r\nlife?  If it were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I\r\nwho would have to go to keep them company."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Do as you will," said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over,\r\n"we are in the hands of God!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.\r\nHow can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true,\r\nand so brave!  And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of\r\nmoney!  What can it not do when basely used.  I felt so thankful that\r\nLord Godalming is rich, and both he and Mr. Morris, who also has\r\nplenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely.  For if they did\r\nnot, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so\r\nwell equipped, as it will within another hour.  It is not three hours\r\nsince it was arranged what part each of us was to do.  And now Lord\r\nGodalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready\r\nto start at a moment''s notice.  Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a\r\ndozen good horses, well appointed.  We have all the maps and\r\nappliances of various kinds that can be had.  Professor Van Helsing\r\nand I are to leave by the 11:40 train tonight for Veresti, where we\r\nare to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.  We are bringing a\r\ngood deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses.  We\r\nshall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the\r\nmatter.  The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so\r\nwe shall get on all right.  We have all got arms, even for me a large\r\nbore revolver.  Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like\r\nthe rest.  Alas!  I cannot carry one arm that the rest do, the scar on\r\nmy forehead forbids that.  Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling\r\nme that I am fully armed as there may be wolves.  The weather is\r\ngetting colder every hour, and there are snow flurries which come and\r\ngo as warnings.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--It took all my courage to say goodbye to my darling.  We may\r\nnever meet again.  Courage, Mina!  The Professor is looking at you\r\nkeenly.  His look is a warning.  There must be no tears now, unless it\r\nmay be that God will let them fall in gladness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n30 October, night.--I am writing this in the light from the furnace\r\ndoor of the steam launch.  Lord Godalming is firing up.  He is an\r\nexperienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his\r\nown on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads.  Regarding our\r\nplans, we finally decided that Mina''s guess was correct, and that if\r\nany waterway was chosen for the Count''s escape back to his Castle, the\r\nSereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one.  We\r\ntook it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would\r\nbe the place chosen for crossing the country between the river and the\r\nCarpathians.  We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at\r\nnight.  There is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart\r\nto make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough.  Lord Godalming tells\r\nme to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be\r\non watch.  But I cannot sleep, how can I with the terrible danger\r\nhanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy only comfort is that we are in the hands of God.  Only for that\r\nfaith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all\r\nthe trouble.  Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride\r\nbefore we started.  They are to keep up the right bank, far enough off\r\nto get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and\r\navoid the following of its curves.  They have, for the first stages,\r\ntwo men to ride and lead their spare horses, four in all, so as not to\r\nexcite curiosity.  When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly,\r\nthey shall themselves look after the horses.  It may be necessary for\r\nus to join forces.  If so they can mount our whole party.  One of the\r\nsaddles has a moveable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if\r\nrequired.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is a wild adventure we are on.  Here, as we are rushing along\r\nthrough the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up\r\nand strike us, with all the mysterious voices of the night around us,\r\nit all comes home.  We seem to be drifting into unknown places and\r\nunknown ways.  Into a whole world of dark and dreadful things.\r\nGodalming is shutting the furnace door&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n31 October.--Still hurrying along.  The day has come, and Godalming is\r\nsleeping.  I am on watch.  The morning is bitterly cold, the furnace\r\nheat is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats.  As yet we have\r\npassed only a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or\r\npackage of anything like the size of the one we seek.  The men were\r\nscared every time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on\r\ntheir knees and prayed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1 November, evening.--No news all day.  We have found nothing of the\r\nkind we seek.  We have now passed into the Bistritza, and if we are\r\nwrong in our surmise our chance is gone.  We have overhauled every\r\nboat, big and little.  Early this morning, one crew took us for a\r\nGovernment boat, and treated us accordingly.  We saw in this a way of\r\nsmoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the\r\nSereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously.  With\r\nevery boat which we have overhauled since then this trick has\r\nsucceeded.  We have had every deference shown to us, and not once any\r\nobjection to whatever we chose to ask or do.  Some of the Slovaks tell\r\nus that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she\r\nhad a double crew on board.  This was before they came to Fundu, so\r\nthey could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or\r\ncontinued on up the Sereth.  At Fundu we could not hear of any such\r\nboat, so she must have passed there in the night.  I am feeling very\r\nsleepy.  The cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature\r\nmust have rest some time.  Godalming insists that he shall keep the\r\nfirst watch.  God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and\r\nme.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 November, morning.--It is broad daylight.  That good fellow would\r\nnot wake me.  He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept\r\npeacefully and was forgetting my trouble.  It seems brutally selfish\r\nto me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night, but he was\r\nquite right.  I am a new man this morning.  And, as I sit here and\r\nwatch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding\r\nthe engine, steering, and keeping watch.  I can feel that my strength\r\nand energy are coming back to me.  I wonder where Mina is now, and Van\r\nHelsing.  They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday.  It\r\nwould take them some time to get the carriage and horses.  So if they\r\nhad started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo\r\nPass.  God guide and help them!  I am afraid to think what may\r\nhappen.  If we could only go faster.  But we cannot.  The engines are\r\nthrobbing and doing their utmost.  I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr.\r\nMorris are getting on.  There seem to be endless streams running down\r\nthe mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large, at\r\npresent, at all events, though they are doubtless terrible in winter\r\nand when the snow melts, the horsemen may not have met much\r\nobstruction.  I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them.\r\nFor if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be\r\nnecessary to take counsel together what to do next.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 November.--Three days on the road.  No news, and no time to write it\r\nif there had been, for every moment is precious.  We have had only the\r\nrest needful for the horses.  But we are both bearing it wonderfully.\r\nThose adventurous days of ours are turning up useful.  We must push\r\non.  We shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3 November.--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the\r\nBistritza.  I wish it wasn''t so cold.  There are signs of snow coming.\r\nAnd if it falls heavy it will stop us.  In such case we must get a\r\nsledge and go on, Russian fashion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n4 November.--Today we heard of the launch having been detained by an\r\naccident when trying to force a way up the rapids.  The Slovak boats\r\nget up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge.  Some\r\nwent up only a few hours before.  Godalming is an amateur fitter\r\nhimself, and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off\r\non the chase afresh.  I fear that the boat is not any better for the\r\naccident, the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water\r\nagain, she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in\r\nsight.  We must push on harder than ever.  Our help may be wanted\r\nsoon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n31 October.--Arrived at Veresti at noon.  The Professor tells me that\r\nthis morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotize me at all, and that all\r\nI could say was, "dark and quiet."  He is off now buying a carriage\r\nand horses.  He says that he will later on try to buy additional\r\nhorses, so that we may be able to change them on the way.  We have\r\nsomething more than 70 miles before us.  The country is lovely, and\r\nmost interesting.  If only we were under different conditions, how\r\ndelightful it would be to see it all.  If Jonathan and I were driving\r\nthrough it alone what a pleasure it would be.  To stop and see people,\r\nand learn something of their life, and to fill our minds and memories\r\nwith all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful\r\ncountry and the quaint people!  But, alas!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater.--Dr. Van Helsing has returned.  He has got the carriage and\r\nhorses.  We are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour.  The\r\nlandlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions.  It seems\r\nenough for a company of soldiers.  The Professor encourages her, and\r\nwhispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any food again.\r\nHe has been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of\r\nfur coats and wraps, and all sorts of warm things.  There will not be\r\nany chance of our being cold.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe shall soon be off.  I am afraid to think what may happen to us.  We\r\nare truly in the hands of God.  He alone knows what may be, and I pray\r\nHim, with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will\r\nwatch over my beloved husband.  That whatever may happen, Jonathan may\r\nknow that I loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my\r\nlatest and truest thought will be always for him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');

The\r\nhorses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go\r\nwillingly their full stage at best speed.  We have now had so many\r\nchanges and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged\r\nto think that the journey will be an easy one.  Dr. Van Helsing is\r\nlaconic, he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and\r\npays them well to make the exchange of horses.  We get hot soup, or\r\ncoffee, or tea, and off we go.  It is a lovely country.  Full of\r\nbeauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and\r\nstrong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities.  They are very,\r\nvery superstitious.  In the first house where we stopped, when the\r\nwoman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself\r\nand put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.  I\r\nbelieve they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic\r\ninto our food, and I can''t abide garlic.  Ever since then I have taken\r\ncare not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their\r\nsuspicions.  We are travelling fast, and as we have no driver with us\r\nto carry tales, we go ahead of scandal.  But I daresay that fear of\r\nthe evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way.  The Professor\r\nseems tireless.  All day he would not take any rest, though he made me\r\nsleep for a long spell.  At sunset time he hypnotized me, and he says\r\nI answered as usual, "darkness, lapping water and creaking wood."  So\r\nour enemy is still on the river.  I am afraid to think of Jonathan,\r\nbut somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself.  I write this\r\nwhilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be ready.  Dr. Van\r\nHelsing is sleeping.  Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and grey,\r\nbut his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror''s.  Even in his sleep he\r\nis intense with resolution.  When we have well started I must make him\r\nrest whilst I drive.  I shall tell him that we have days before us,\r\nand he must not break down when most of all his strength will be\r\nneeded&#8230; All is ready.  We are off shortly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 November, morning.--I was successful, and we took turns driving all\r\nnight.  Now the day is on us, bright though cold.  There is a strange\r\nheaviness in the air.  I say heaviness for want of a better word.  I\r\nmean that it oppresses us both.  It is very cold, and only our warm\r\nfurs keep us comfortable.  At dawn Van Helsing hypnotized me.  He says\r\nI answered "darkness, creaking wood and roaring water," so the river\r\nis changing as they ascend.  I do hope that my darling will not run\r\nany chance of danger, more than need be, but we are in God''s hands.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n2 November, night.--All day long driving.  The country gets wilder as\r\nwe go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed\r\nso far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us\r\nand tower in front.  We both seem in good spirits.  I think we make an\r\neffort each to cheer the other, in the doing so we cheer ourselves.\r\nDr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass.\r\nThe houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last\r\nhorse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to\r\nchange.  He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we\r\nhave a rude four-in-hand.  The dear horses are patient and good, and\r\nthey give us no trouble.  We are not worried with other travellers,\r\nand so even I can drive.  We shall get to the Pass in daylight.  We do\r\nnot want to arrive before.  So we take it easy, and have each a long\r\nrest in turn.  Oh, what will tomorrow bring to us?  We go to seek the\r\nplace where my poor darling suffered so much.  God grant that we may\r\nbe guided aright, and that He will deign to watch over my husband and\r\nthose dear to us both, and who are in such deadly peril.  As for me, I\r\nam not worthy in His sight.  Alas!  I am unclean to His eyes, and\r\nshall be until He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one\r\nof those who have not incurred His wrath.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMEMORANDUM BY ABRAHAM VAN HELSING\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n4 November.--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D.,\r\nof Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him.  It may\r\nexplain.  It is morning, and I write by a fire which all\r\nthe night I have kept alive, Madam Mina aiding me.  It is\r\ncold, cold.  So cold that the grey heavy sky is full of\r\nsnow, which when it falls will settle for all winter as the\r\nground is hardening to receive it.  It seems to have affected\r\nMadam Mina.  She has been so heavy of head all day that she was\r\nnot like herself.  She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps!  She who\r\nis usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day.  She\r\neven have lost her appetite.  She make no entry into her little\r\ndiary, she who write so faithful at every pause.  Something\r\nwhisper to me that all is not well.  However, tonight she is more\r\n<i>vif</i>.  Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for\r\nnow she is all sweet and bright as ever.  At sunset I try to\r\nhypnotize her, but alas! with no effect.  The power has grown\r\nless and less with each day, and tonight it fail me altogether.\r\nWell, God''s will be done, whatever it may be, and whithersoever\r\nit may lead!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her\r\nstenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so\r\neach day of us may not go unrecorded.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday\r\nmorning.  When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for\r\nthe hypnotism.  We stopped our carriage, and got down so\r\nthat there might be no disturbance.  I made a couch with\r\nfurs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual,\r\nbut more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic\r\nsleep.  As before, came the answer, "darkness and the swirling of\r\nwater."  Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way\r\nand soon reach the Pass.  At this time and place, she become all\r\non fire with zeal.  Some new guiding power be in her manifested,\r\nfor she point to a road and say, "This is the way."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How know you it?" I ask.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Of course I know it," she answer, and with a pause, add,\r\n"Have not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be\r\nonly one such byroad.  It is used but little, and very different\r\nfrom the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more\r\nwide and hard, and more of use.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo we came down this road.  When we meet other ways, not\r\nalways were we sure that they were roads at all, for they\r\nbe neglect and light snow have fallen, the horses know and\r\nthey only.  I give rein to them, and they go on so patient.  By\r\nand by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that\r\nwonderful diary of him.  Then we go on for long, long hours and\r\nhours.  At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep.  She try, and\r\nshe succeed.  She sleep all the time, till at the last, I feel\r\nmyself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her.  But she\r\nsleep on, and I may not wake her though I try.  I do not wish to\r\ntry too hard lest I harm her.  For I know that she have suffer\r\nmuch, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her.  I think I drowse\r\nmyself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done\r\nsomething.  I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and\r\nthe good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever.  I look down and\r\nfind Madam Mina still asleep.  It is now not far off sunset time,\r\nand over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,\r\nso that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so\r\nsteep.  For we are going up, and up, and all is oh so wild and\r\nrocky, as though it were the end of the world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen I arouse Madam Mina.  This time she wake with not much\r\ntrouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep.  But\r\nshe sleep not, being as though I were not.  Still I try and\r\ntry, till all at once I find her and myself in dark, so I\r\nlook round, and find that the sun have gone down.  Madam\r\nMina laugh, and I turn and look at her.  She is now quite\r\nawake, and look so well as I never saw her since that night\r\nat Carfax when we first enter the Count''s house.  I am amaze, and\r\nnot at ease then.  But she is so bright and tender and thoughtful\r\nfor me that I forget all fear.  I light a fire, for we have\r\nbrought supply of wood with us, and she prepare food while I undo\r\nthe horses and set them, tethered in shelter, to feed.  Then when\r\nI return to the fire she have my supper ready.  I go to help her,\r\nbut she smile, and tell me that she have eat already.  That she\r\nwas so hungry that she would not wait.  I like it not, and I have\r\ngrave doubts.  But I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of\r\nit.  She help me and I eat alone, and then we wrap in fur and lie\r\nbeside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch.  But\r\npresently I forget all of watching.  And when I sudden remember\r\nthat I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at\r\nme with so bright eyes.  Once, twice more the same occur, and I\r\nget much sleep till before morning.  When I wake I try to\r\nhypnotize her, but alas! though she shut her eyes obedient, she\r\nmay not sleep.  The sun rise up, and up, and up, and then sleep\r\ncome to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake.  I\r\nhave to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when\r\nI have harnessed the horses and made all ready.  Madam still\r\nsleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder\r\nthan before.  And I like it not.  And I am afraid, afraid,\r\nafraid!  I am afraid of all things, even to think but I must go\r\non my way.  The stake we play for is life and death, or more than\r\nthese, and we must not flinch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n5 November, morning.--Let me be accurate in everything, for\r\nthough you and I have seen some strange things together,\r\nyou may at the first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad.\r\nThat the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has\r\nat the last turn my brain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll yesterday we travel, always getting closer to the\r\nmountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert\r\nland.  There are great, frowning precipices and much falling\r\nwater, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival.  Madam\r\nMina still sleep and sleep.  And though I did have hunger and\r\nappeased it, I could not waken her, even for food.  I began to\r\nfear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as\r\nshe is with that Vampire baptism.  "Well," said I to myself, "if\r\nit be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not\r\nsleep at night."  As we travel on the rough road, for a road of\r\nan ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and\r\nslept.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAgain I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and\r\nfound Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down.  But\r\nall was indeed changed.  The frowning mountains seemed further\r\naway, and we were near the top of a steep rising hill, on summit\r\nof which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary.  At\r\nonce I exulted and feared.  For now, for good or ill, the end was\r\nnear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotize her, but\r\nalas!  unavailing till too late.  Then, ere the great dark\r\ncame upon us, for even after down sun the heavens reflected\r\nthe gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great\r\ntwilight.  I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I\r\ncould.  Then I make a fire, and near it I make Madam Mina, now\r\nawake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs.\r\nI got ready food, but she would not eat, simply saying that she\r\nhad not hunger.  I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness.\r\nBut I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all.  Then,\r\nwith the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for\r\nher comfort, round where Madam Mina sat.  And over the ring I\r\npassed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was\r\nwell guarded.  She sat still all the time, so still as one dead.\r\nAnd she grew whiter and even whiter till the snow was not more\r\npale, and no word she said.  But when I drew near, she clung to\r\nme, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to\r\nfeet with a tremor that was pain to feel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet,\r\n"Will you not come over to the fire?" for I wished to make\r\na test of what she could.  She rose obedient, but when she\r\nhave made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Why not go on?" I asked.  She shook her head, and coming\r\nback, sat down in her place.  Then, looking at me with open\r\neyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply, "I cannot!"\r\nand remained silent.  I rejoiced, for I knew that what she could\r\nnot, none of those that we dreaded could.  Though there might be\r\ndanger to her body, yet her soul was safe!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPresently the horses began to scream, and tore at their\r\ntethers till I came to them and quieted them.  When they\r\ndid feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and\r\nlicked at my hands and were quiet for a time.  Many times\r\nthrough the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the\r\ncold hour when all nature is at lowest, and every time my\r\ncoming was with quiet of them.  In the cold hour the fire\r\nbegan to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish\r\nit, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a\r\nchill mist.  Even in the dark there was a light of some\r\nkind, as there ever is over snow, and it seemed as though\r\nthe snow flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of\r\nwomen with trailing garments.  All was in dead, grim silence only\r\nthat the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the\r\nworst.  I began to fear, horrible fears.  But then came to me the\r\nsense of safety in that ring wherein I stood.  I began too, to\r\nthink that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and\r\nthe unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible\r\nanxiety.  It was as though my memories of all Jonathan''s horrid\r\nexperience were befooling me.  For the snow flakes and the mist\r\nbegan to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a\r\nshadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him.  And\r\nthen the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as\r\nmen do in pain.  Even the madness of fright was not to them, so\r\nthat they could break away.  I feared for my dear Madam Mina when\r\nthese weird figures drew near and circled round.  I looked at her,\r\nbut she sat calm, and smiled at me.  When I would have stepped to\r\nthe fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and\r\nwhispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No!  No!  Do not go without.  Here you are safe!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI turned to her, and looking in her eyes said, "But you?\r\nIt is for you that I fear!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhereat she laughed, a laugh low and unreal, and said, "Fear\r\nfor me!  Why fear for me?  None safer in all the world from\r\nthem than I am," and as I wondered at the meaning of her\r\nwords, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the\r\nred scar on her forehead.  Then, alas!  I knew.  Did I not,\r\nI would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist\r\nand snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy\r\ncircle.  Then they began to materialize till, if God have\r\nnot taken away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes.\r\nThere were before me in actual flesh the same three women\r\nthat Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed\r\nhis throat.  I knew the swaying round forms, the bright\r\nhard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous\r\nlips.  They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina.  And as\r\ntheir laugh came through the silence of the night, they\r\ntwined their arms and pointed to her, and said in those so\r\nsweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable\r\nsweetness of the water glasses, "Come, sister.  Come to us.\r\nCome!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with\r\ngladness leapt like flame.  For oh! the terror in her sweet\r\neyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart\r\nthat was all of hope.  God be thanked she was not, yet, of\r\nthem.  I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and\r\nholding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the\r\nfire.  They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid\r\nlaugh.  I fed the fire, and feared them not.  For I knew that we\r\nwere safe within the ring, which she could not leave no more than\r\nthey could enter.  The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still\r\non the ground.  The snow fell on them softly, and they grew\r\nwhiter.  I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of\r\nterror.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so we remained till the red of the dawn began to fall\r\nthrough the snow gloom.  I was desolate and afraid, and\r\nfull of woe and terror.  But when that beautiful sun began\r\nto climb the horizon life was to me again.  At the first\r\ncoming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling\r\nmist and snow.  The wreaths of transparent gloom moved away\r\ntowards the castle, and were lost.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInstinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina,\r\nintending to hypnotize her.  But she lay in a deep and sudden\r\nsleep, from which I could not wake her.  I tried to hypnotize\r\nthrough her sleep, but she made no response, none at all, and the\r\nday broke.  I fear yet to stir.  I have made my fire and have\r\nseen the horses, they are all dead.  Today I have much to do here,\r\nand I keep waiting till the sun is up high.  For there may be\r\nplaces where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist\r\nobscure it, will be to me a safety.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will do my\r\nterrible work.  Madam Mina still sleeps, and God be thanked!  She\r\nis calm in her sleep&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n4 November, evening.--The accident to the launch has been a terrible\r\nthing for us.  Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago,\r\nand by now my dear Mina would have been free.  I fear to think of her,\r\noff on the wolds near that horrid place.  We have got horses, and we\r\nfollow on the track.  I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready.\r\nWe have our arms.  The Szgany must look out if they mean to fight.  Oh,\r\nif only Morris and Seward were with us.  We must only hope!  If I\r\nwrite no more Goodby Mina!  God bless and keep you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. SEWARD''S DIARY\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n5 November.--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing\r\naway from the river with their leiter wagon.  They surrounded it in a\r\ncluster, and hurried along as though beset.  The snow is falling\r\nlightly and there is a strange excitement in the air.  It may be our\r\nown feelings, but the depression is strange.  Far off I hear the\r\nhowling of wolves.  The snow brings them down from the mountains, and\r\nthere are dangers to all of us, and from all sides.  The horses are\r\nnearly ready, and we are soon off.  We ride to death of some one.  God\r\nalone knows who, or where, or what, or when, or how it may be&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDR. VAN HELSING''S MEMORANDUM\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n5 November, afternoon.--I am at least sane.  Thank God for\r\nthat mercy at all events, though the proving it has been\r\ndreadful.  When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy\r\ncircle, I took my way to the castle.  The blacksmith hammer\r\nwhich I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful, though the\r\ndoors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some\r\nill intent or ill chance should close them, so that being entered\r\nI might not get out.  Jonathan''s bitter experience served me\r\nhere.  By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel,\r\nfor I knew that here my work lay.  The air was oppressive.  It\r\nseemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made\r\nme dizzy.  Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar\r\noff the howl of wolves.  Then I bethought me of my dear Madam\r\nMina, and I was in terrible plight.  The dilemma had me between\r\nhis horns.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe\r\nfrom the Vampire in that Holy circle.  And yet even there\r\nwould be the wolf!  I resolve me that my work lay here, and\r\nthat as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God''s will.  At\r\nany rate it was only death and freedom beyond.  So did I choose\r\nfor her.  Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy,\r\nthe maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the\r\nVampire!  So I make my choice to go on with my work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI knew that there were at least three graves to find, graves\r\nthat are inhabit.  So I search, and search, and I find one\r\nof them.  She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and\r\nvoluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to\r\ndo murder.  Ah, I doubt not that in the old time, when such\r\nthings were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as\r\nmine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his\r\nnerve.  So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere\r\nbeauty and the fascination of the wanton Undead have hypnotize\r\nhim.  And he remain on and on, till sunset come, and the Vampire\r\nsleep be over.  Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open\r\nand look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss, and\r\nthe man is weak.  And there remain one more victim in the\r\nVampire fold.  One more to swell the grim and grisly ranks\r\nof the Undead!&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the\r\nmere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a\r\ntomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries,\r\nthough there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the\r\nCount have had.  Yes, I was moved.  I, Van Helsing, with\r\nall my purpose and with my motive for hate.  I was moved to\r\na yearning for delay which seemed to paralyze my faculties\r\nand to clog my very soul.  It may have been that the need\r\nof natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air\r\nwere beginning to overcome me.  Certain it was that I was\r\nlapsing into sleep, the open eyed sleep of one who yields\r\nto a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled\r\nair a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me\r\nlike the sound of a clarion.  For it was the voice of my dear\r\nMadam Mina that I heard.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by\r\nwrenching away tomb tops one other of the sisters, the other dark\r\none.  I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister,\r\nlest once more I should begin to be enthrall.  But I go on\r\nsearching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if\r\nmade to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like\r\nJonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the\r\nmist.  She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so\r\nexquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me,\r\nwhich calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers,\r\nmade my head whirl with new emotion.  But God be thanked, that\r\nsoul wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears.\r\nAnd, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had\r\nnerved myself to my wild work.  By this time I had searched all\r\nthe tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell.  And as there\r\nhad been only three of these Undead phantoms around us in the\r\nnight, I took it that there were no more of active Undead\r\nexistent.  There was one great tomb more lordly than all the\r\nrest.  Huge it was, and nobly proportioned.  On it was but one\r\nword.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n            DRACULA<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis then was the Undead home of the King Vampire, to whom\r\nso many more were due.  Its emptiness spoke eloquent to\r\nmake certain what I knew.  Before I began to restore these\r\nwomen to their dead selves through my awful work, I laid in\r\nDracula''s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished him from\r\nit, Undead, for ever.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen began my terrible task, and I dreaded it.  Had it been\r\nbut one, it had been easy, comparative.  But three!  To\r\nbegin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror.\r\nFor it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it\r\nnot be with these strange ones who had survived through\r\ncenturies, and who had been strengthened by the passing of\r\nthe years.  Who would, if they could, have fought for their\r\nfoul lives&#8230;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOh, my friend John, but it was butcher work.  Had I not\r\nbeen nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living\r\nover whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone\r\non.  I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was\r\nover, God be thanked, my nerve did stand.  Had I not seen\r\nthe repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole\r\nover it just ere the final dissolution came, as realization\r\nthat the soul had been won, I could not have gone further\r\nwith my butchery.  I could not have endured the horrid screeching\r\nas the stake drove home, the plunging of writhing form, and lips\r\nof bloody foam.  I should have fled in terror and left my work\r\nundone.  But it is over!  And the poor souls, I can pity them now\r\nand weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of\r\ndeath for a short moment ere fading.  For, friend John, hardly\r\nhad my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body\r\nbegan to melt away and crumble into its native dust, as though\r\nthe death that should have come centuries ago had at last assert\r\nhimself and say at once and loud, "I am here!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never\r\nmore can the Count enter there Undead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she\r\nwoke from her sleep and, seeing me, cried out in pain that\r\nI had endured too much.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Come!" she said, "come away from this awful place!  Let us\r\ngo to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us."\r\nShe was looking thin and pale and weak.  But her eyes were\r\npure and glowed with fervour.  I was glad to see her paleness and\r\nher illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that\r\nruddy vampire sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go\r\neastward to meet our friends, and him, whom Madam Mina tell\r\nme that she know are coming to meet us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMINA HARKER''S JOURNAL\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n6 November.--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I\r\ntook our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming.  We\r\ndid not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to\r\ntake heavy rugs and wraps with us.  We dared not face the possibility\r\nof being left without warmth in the cold and the snow.  We had to take\r\nsome of our provisions too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and\r\nso far as we could see through the snowfall, there was not even the\r\nsign of habitation.  When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with\r\nthe heavy walking and sat down to rest.  Then we looked back and saw\r\nwhere the clear line of Dracula''s castle cut the sky.  For we were so\r\ndeep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective\r\nof the Carpathian mountains was far below it.  We saw it in all its\r\ngrandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice,\r\nand with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the\r\nadjacent mountain on any side.  There was something wild and uncanny\r\nabout the place.  We could hear the distant howling of wolves.  They\r\nwere far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through the\r\ndeadening snowfall, was full of terror.  I knew from the way Dr. Van\r\nHelsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic\r\npoint, where we would be less exposed in case of attack.  The rough\r\nroadway still led downwards.  We could trace it through the drifted\r\nsnow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and\r\njoined him.  He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow\r\nin a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders.  He\r\ntook me by the hand and drew me in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"See!" he said, "here you will be in shelter.  And if the wolves do\r\ncome I can meet them one by one."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some\r\nprovisions and forced them upon me.  But I could not eat, to even try\r\nto do so was repulsive to me, and much as I would have liked to please\r\nhim, I could not bring myself to the attempt.  He looked very sad, but\r\ndid not reproach me.  Taking his field glasses from the case, he stood\r\non the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly he called out, "Look!  Madam Mina, look!  Look!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI sprang up and stood beside him on the rock.  He handed me his\r\nglasses and pointed.  The snow was now falling more heavily, and\r\nswirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow.\r\nHowever, there were times when there were pauses between the snow\r\nflurries and I could see a long way round.  From the height where we\r\nwere it was possible to see a great distance.  And far off, beyond the\r\nwhite waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon\r\nin kinks and curls as it wound its way.  Straight in front of us and\r\nnot far off, in fact so near that I wondered we had not noticed\r\nbefore, came a group of mounted men hurrying along.  In the midst of\r\nthem was a cart, a long leiter wagon which swept from side to side,\r\nlike a dog''s tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road.\r\nOutlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the men''s\r\nclothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn the cart was a great square chest.  My heart leaped as I saw it, for\r\nI felt that the end was coming.  The evening was now drawing close,\r\nand well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then\r\nimprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many\r\nforms elude pursuit.  In fear I turned to the Professor.  To my\r\nconsternation, however, he was not there.  An instant later, I saw him\r\nbelow me.  Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found\r\nshelter in last night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he had completed it he stood beside me again saying, "At least\r\nyou shall be safe here from him!"  He took the glasses from me, and at\r\nthe next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.  "See," he\r\nsaid, "they come quickly.  They are flogging the horses, and galloping\r\nas hard as they can."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe paused and went on in a hollow voice, "They are racing for the\r\nsunset.  We may be too late.  God''s will be done!"  Down came another\r\nblinding rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted\r\nout.  It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed on\r\nthe plain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen came a sudden cry, "Look!  Look!  Look!  See, two horsemen follow\r\nfast, coming up from the south.  It must be Quincey and John.  Take\r\nthe glass.  Look before the snow blots it all out!"  I took it and\r\nlooked.  The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris.  I knew at\r\nall events that neither of them was Jonathan.  At the same time I knew\r\nthat Jonathan was not far off.  Looking around I saw on the north side\r\nof the coming party two other men, riding at breakneck speed.  One of\r\nthem I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course, to be Lord\r\nGodalming.  They too, were pursuing the party with the cart.  When I\r\ntold the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and after\r\nlooking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his\r\nWinchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of\r\nour shelter.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"They are all converging," he said.  "When the time comes we shall have\r\ngypsies on all sides."  I got out my revolver ready to hand, for\r\nwhilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer.\r\nWhen the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.  It was strange\r\nto see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond,\r\nthe sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far\r\nmountain tops.  Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and\r\nthere dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers.\r\nThe wolves were gathering for their prey.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEvery instant seemed an age whilst we waited.  The wind came now in\r\nfierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us\r\nin circling eddies.  At times we could not see an arm''s length before\r\nus.  But at others, as the hollow sounding wind swept by us, it seemed\r\nto clear the air space around us so that we could see afar off.  We\r\nhad of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that\r\nwe knew with fair accuracy when it would be.  And we knew that before\r\nlong the sun would set.  It was hard to believe that by our watches it\r\nwas less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the\r\nvarious bodies began to converge close upon us.  The wind came now\r\nwith fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the\r\nnorth.  It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for with only\r\noccasional bursts, the snow fell.  We could distinguish clearly the\r\nindividuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers.  Strangely\r\nenough those pursued did not seem to realize, or at least to care,\r\nthat they were pursued.  They seemed, however, to hasten with\r\nredoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain\r\ntops.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCloser and closer they drew.  The Professor and I crouched down behind\r\nour rock, and held our weapons ready.  I could see that he was\r\ndetermined that they should not pass.  One and all were quite unaware\r\nof our presence.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll at once two voices shouted out to "Halt!"  One was my Jonathan''s,\r\nraised in a high key of passion.  The other Mr. Morris'' strong\r\nresolute tone of quiet command.  The gypsies may not have known the\r\nlanguage, but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the\r\nwords were spoken.  Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant\r\nLord Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and\r\nMr. Morris on the other.  The leader of the gypsies, a splendid\r\nlooking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and\r\nin a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed.  They\r\nlashed the horses which sprang forward.  But the four men raised their\r\nWinchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop.\r\nAt the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and\r\npointed our weapons at them.  Seeing that they were surrounded the men\r\ntightened their reins and drew up.  The leader turned to them and gave\r\na word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he\r\ncarried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack.\r\nIssue was joined in an instant.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in\r\nfront, and pointed first to the sun, now close down on the hill tops,\r\nand then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.\r\nFor answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their\r\nhorses and dashed towards the cart.  I should have felt terrible fear\r\nat seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardor of battle must\r\nhave been upon me as well as the rest of them.  I felt no fear, but\r\nonly a wild, surging desire to do something.  Seeing the quick\r\nmovement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command.  His\r\nmen instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined\r\nendeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness\r\nto carry out the order.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring\r\nof men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart.  It\r\nwas evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun\r\nshould set.  Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them.  Neither\r\nthe levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front,\r\nnor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their\r\nattention.  Jonathan''s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his\r\npurpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him.  Instinctively they\r\ncowered aside and let him pass.  In an instant he had jumped upon the\r\ncart, and with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great\r\nbox, and flung it over the wheel to the ground.  In the meantime, Mr.\r\nMorris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of\r\nSzgany.  All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,\r\nwith the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and\r\nhad seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them,\r\nand they cut at him.  He had parried with his great bowie knife, and\r\nat first I thought that he too had come through in safety.  But as he\r\nsprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could\r\nsee that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the\r\nblood was spurting through his fingers.  He did not delay\r\nnotwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked\r\none end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great\r\nKukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie.  Under\r\nthe efforts of both men the lid began to yield.  The nails drew with a\r\nscreeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the\r\nWinchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had\r\ngiven in and made no further resistance.  The sun was almost down on\r\nthe mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell upon the\r\nsnow.  I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of\r\nwhich the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him.  He was\r\ndeathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with\r\nthe horrible vindictive look which I knew so well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in\r\nthem turned to triumph.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan''s great\r\nknife.  I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat.  Whilst at\r\nthe same moment Mr. Morris''s bowie knife plunged into the heart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was like a miracle, but before our very eyes, and almost in the\r\ndrawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from\r\nour sight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final\r\ndissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never\r\ncould have imagined might have rested there.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every\r\nstone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of\r\nthe setting sun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary\r\ndisappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away\r\nas if for their lives.  Those who were unmounted jumped upon the\r\nleiter wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them.  The\r\nwolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their\r\nwake, leaving us alone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding\r\nhis hand pressed to his side.  The blood still gushed through his\r\nfingers.  I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back;\r\nso did the two doctors.  Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man\r\nlaid back his head on his shoulder.  With a sigh he took, with a\r\nfeeble effort, my hand in that of his own which was unstained.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled at\r\nme and said, "I am only too happy to have been of service!  Oh, God!"\r\nhe cried suddenly, struggling to a sitting posture and pointing to me.\r\n"It was worth for this to die!  Look!  Look!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams\r\nfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light.  With one\r\nimpulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest "Amen"\r\nbroke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe dying man spoke, "Now God be thanked that all has not been in\r\nvain!  See!  The snow is not more stainless than her forehead!  The\r\ncurse has passed away!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a\r\ngallant gentleman.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNOTE\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSeven years ago we all went through the flames.  And the happiness of\r\nsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured.\r\nIt is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy''s birthday is the\r\nsame day as that on which Quincey Morris died.  His mother holds, I\r\nknow, the secret belief that some of our brave friend''s spirit has\r\npassed into him.  His bundle of names links all our little band of men\r\ntogether.  But we call him Quincey.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went\r\nover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and\r\nterrible memories.  It was almost impossible to believe that the\r\nthings which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears\r\nwere living truths.  Every trace of all that had been was blotted\r\nout.  The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of\r\ndesolation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we got home we were talking of the old time, which we could all\r\nlook back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both\r\nhappily married.  I took the papers from the safe where they had been\r\never since our return so long ago.  We were struck with the fact, that\r\nin all the mass of material of which the record is composed, there is\r\nhardly one authentic document.  Nothing but a mass of typewriting,\r\nexcept the later notebooks of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van\r\nHelsing''s memorandum.  We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish\r\nto, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story.  Van Helsing summed\r\nit all up as he said, with our boy on his knee.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We want no proofs.  We ask none to believe us!  This boy will some\r\nday know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is.  Already he\r\nknows her sweetness and loving care.  Later on he will understand how\r\nsome men so loved her, that they did dare much for her sake."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJONATHAN HARKER\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n');
