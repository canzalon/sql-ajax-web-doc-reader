sql-ajax-web-doc-reader
=======================

A simple document reader that asynchronously delivers html files, stored in a database, to the html/javascript front-end upon request. A php file on the server that the website is hosted on fulfills the javascript GET requests. The Javascript utilizes the built-in javascript XMLHttpRequest object's methods and properties to deliver the data asynchronously to the HTML DOM. Though, unlike the similar ajax-web-doc-reader project where the files were located locally in the directory of the website, this system will be able to get the files from a sql database. The major changes distinguishing this project from its predecessor is located within the PHP code. It queries the database it is connected to remotely to get the data, using built-in functionality, and sends it back to the requesting javascript XMLHttpRequest objects, which then relay the information to the HTML DOM.  

The php file in this project establishes a connection to the server with the provided credentials for the sql server. It then, depending on the query, constructs and executes a query to get the information asked for from the database. This process of obtaining information from the database involves the creation of a representation of JSON containing the required fields. To accomplish this, an object in php is created with the necessary fields used to store the values retrieved from the respective database query.
